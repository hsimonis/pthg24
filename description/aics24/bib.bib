abstract = {Bibliometric analysis is a popular and rigorous method for exploring and analyzing large volumes of scientific data. It enables us to unpack the evolutionary nuances of a specific field, while shedding light on the emerging areas in that field. Yet, its application in business research is relatively new, and in many instances, underdeveloped. Accordingly, we endeavor to present an overview of the bibliometric methodology, with a particular focus on its different techniques, while offering step-by-step guidelines that can be relied upon to rigorously perform bibliometric analysis with confidence. To this end, we also shed light on when and how bibliometric analysis should be used vis-à-vis other similar techniques such as meta-analysis and systematic literature reviews. As a whole, this paper should be a useful resource for gaining insights on the available techniques and procedures for carrying out studies using bibliometric analysis.}

    abstract = "{OpenCitations is an infrastructure organization for open scholarship dedicated to the publication of open citation data as Linked Open Data using Semantic Web technologies, thereby providing a disruptive alternative to traditional proprietary citation indexes. Open citation data are valuable for bibliometric analysis, increasing the reproducibility of large-scale analyses by enabling publication of the source data. Following brief introductions to the development and benefits of open scholarship and to Semantic Web technologies, this paper describes OpenCitations and its data sets, tools, services, and activities. These include the OpenCitations Data Model; the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) Ontologies; OpenCitations’ open software of generic applicability for searching, browsing, and providing REST APIs over resource description framework (RDF) triplestores; Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs) and the OpenCitations OCI Resolution Service; the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), a database of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data made available in RDF under a Creative Commons public domain dedication; and the OpenCitations Indexes of open citation data, of which the first and largest is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref Open DOI-to-DOI Citations, which currently contains over 624 million bibliographic citations and is receiving considerable usage by the scholarly community.}",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a novel, two-staged system, for keyword detection and ontology-driven topic modeling. The first stage specializes in keyword detection in which we introduce a novel graph-based unsupervised approach called Collective Connectivity-Aware Node Weight (CoCoNoW) for detecting keywords from the scientific literature. CoCoNoW builds a connectivity aware graph from a given publication text and eventually assigns weight to the extracted keywords to sort them in order of relevance. The second stage specializes in topic modeling, where a domain ontology serves as an attention-map/context for topic modeling based on the detected keywords. The use of an ontology makes this approach independent of domain and language. CoCoNoW is extensively evaluated on three publicly available datasets Hulth2003, NLM500 and SemEval2010. Analysis of results reveals that CoCoNoW consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the respective datasets.",
