 Abstract 
           Constraints are a formalism for the representation of declarative knowledge that allows for a compact and expressive modeling of many real‐life problems. Constraint satisfaction and propagation tools, as well as constraint programming languages, are successfully used to model, solve, and reason about many classes of problems, such as design, diagnosis, scheduling, spatio‐temporal reasoning, resource allocation, configuration, network optimization, and graphical interfaces.

 Abstract  Constraint programming (CP) is based on the fundamental idea that the resolution of hard optimization problems is best approached by the combination of a declarative model specification and the writing of a search procedure. The search procedure explores the underlying search space while taking advantage of the pruning derived from the declarative model. The search is a fundamental ingredient to exploit the specificities of problems that are difficult or near impossible to capture through the declarative model. The flexibility it provides lead to marked successes for truly challenging problems in scheduling, bounded program verification, test generation, and distributed systems, to name just a few. This article offers a gentle introduction to search in CP, what it can do, and how it is used.
