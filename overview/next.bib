abstract = {In this paper, we present a constraint programming model for the routing and scheduling of trains running through a junction. The model uses input data from relevant time events of train runs calculated by a simulator. The model can be integrated into a decision support system used by operators who make decisions to change train routes or orders to avoid conflicts and delays. The model has been applied to a set of problem instances. This set has been defined from a real case study of traffic on the Pierrefitte-Gonesse node, North of Paris. Preliminary results show that the solution identified by the model yields a significant improvement in performance within an acceptable computation time.}
