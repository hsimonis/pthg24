	abstract = {The rational location of emergency medical services could play a crucial part in saving patient’s life by improving access to the facilities. Every year, an increasing number of individuals lose their lives in accidents. One of the main reasons for the increase in mortality is the lack of access to medical facilities on nearby premises. This study aims to locate an optimal location for ambulances near the city’s accident-prone zones, thereby reducing the waiting time of ambulances. The faster the ambulance reaches the accident spot, the quicker a patient will be able to reach the hospital. This study used K-means clustering and the minimax method to locate ambulances at optimal places. Using K-means clustering, clusters for accidentprone zones are formed; according to the value of k accident spots nearby, each other is grouped or clustered together. Finally, using minimax, coordinates for optimal location are calculated. Thus, after a complete study, two optimal locations were found that are most suitable for the location of the ambulance. Thus, the optimal location of an ambulance can help reduce the number of deaths due to road accidents.},

            This article proposes new location models for emergency medical service stations. The models are generated by incorporating a survival function into existing covering models. A survival function is a monotonically decreasing function of the response time of an emergency medical service (EMS) vehicle to a patient that returns the probability of survival for the patient. The survival function allows for the calculation of tangible outcome measures—the expected number of survivors in case of cardiac arrests. The survival‐maximizing location models are better suited for EMS location than the covering models which do not adequately differentiate between consequences of different response times. We demonstrate empirically the superiority of the survival‐maximizing models using data from the Edmonton EMS system. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2008},

The Wearable Health Monitoring System (WHMS) is used to manage and monitor chronic disease in elderly people, postoperative rehabilitation patients and persons with special needs. Location-aware healthcare is achievable as positioning systems and telecommunications have been developed and have fulfilled the technology needed for this kind of healthcare system. In this paper, the researchers propose a Location-Based Mobile Cardiac Emergency System (LMCES) to track the patient’s current location when Emergency Medical Services (EMS) has been activated as well as to locate the nearest healthcare unit for the ambulance service. The location coordinates of the patients can be retrieved by GPS and sent to the healthcare centre using GPRS. The location of the patient, cell ID information will also be transmitted to the LMCES server in order to retrieve the nearest health care unit. For the LMCES, we use Dijkstra’s algorithm for selecting the shortest path between the nearest healthcare unit and the patient location in order to facilitate the ambulance’s path under critical conditions.},

This paper presents the optimization of EMS vehicle fleet allocation and base station location through the use of a genetic algorithm (GA) with an integrated EMS simulation model. Two tiers to the EMS model realized the different demands on two vehicle classes; ambulances and rapid response cars. Multiple patient classes were modelled and survival functions used to differentiate the required levels of service. The objective was maximization of the overall expected survival probability across patient classes. Applications of the model were undertaken using real call data from the London Ambulance Service. The simulation model was shown to effectively emulate real-life performance. Optimization of the existing resource plan resulted in significant improvements in survival probability. Optimizing a selection of 1 hour periods in the plan, without introducing additional resources, resulted in a notable increase in the number of cardiac arrest patients surviving per year. The introduction of an additional base station further improved survival when its location and resourcing were optimized for key periods of service. Also, the removal of a base station from the system was found to have minimal impact on survival probability when the selected station and resourcing were optimized simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to determine if a deployment strategy based on geospatial–time analysis is able to reduce ambulance response times for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OOHCA) in an urban emergency medical services (EMS) system.
Methods: An observational prospective study examining geographic locations of all OOHCA in Singapore was conducted. Locations of cardiac arrests were spot-mapped using a geographic information system (GIS). A progressive strategy of satellite ambulance deployment was implemented, increasing ambulance bases from 17 to 32 locations. Variation in ambulance deployment according to demand, based on time of day, was also implemented. The total number of ambulances and crews remained constant over the study period. The main outcome measure was ambulance response times.
Results: From October 1, 2001, to October 14, 2004, a total of 2,428 OOHCA patients were enrolled into the study. Mean ± SD age for arrests was 60.6 ± 19.3 years with 68.0\% male. The overall return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate was 17.2\% and survival to discharge rate was 1.6\%. Response time decreased significantly as the number of ﬁre stations ⁄ fire posts increased (Pearson v2 = 108.70, df = 48, p {\textless} 0.001). Response times for OOHCA decreased from a monthly median of 10.1 minutes at the beginning to 7.1 minutes at the end of the study. Similarly, the proportion of cases with response times {\textless} 8 minutes increased from 22.3\% to 47.3\% and {\textless} 11 minutes from 57.6\% to 77.5\% at the end of the study.
Conclusions: A simple, relatively low-cost ambulance deployment strategy was associated with significantly reduced response times for OOHCA. Geospatial–time analysis can be a useful tool for EMS providers.},

	abstract = {In order to ensure an adequate service to the population, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) rely on a given number of ambulances strategically located over the territory they serve. The arrival of calls to EMS being highly uncertain and dynamic, it may happen that at some point, the vehicles available to respond to these calls no longer cover properly all regions, even if the coverage was carefully planned initially. Relocation of ambulances may therefore be required during the day in order to achieve better performances. Some models tackling relocation have been proposed in the literature and it has been shown that using such strategies can help to improve overall performances. However, relocation generates movements that produce undesirable consequences from both economical and human resources management standpoints. Questions therefore arise: Is the relocation worth the effort? And if so, what form should it take? Unfortunately, this issue has not been investigated much up to now. This study thus focuses on evaluating and analyzing relocation strategies, and reports extensive simulation experiments allowing to analyze the performance of these strategies when the system faces different levels of workload. Our empirical study conﬁrms that dynamic strategies dominate static ones and quantiﬁes the improvements achieved with respect to service level, but also shows that such improvements are obtained at the expense of signiﬁcant relocation costs.},

This paper proposes a simulation optimization method that enables evaluating the operational performance of deployment plans through a detailed simulation model. For guiding the search process in the simulation optimization method, the genetic algorithm is employed in this study.

However, both quality and timing of service are very costly goals to achieve. In this research, our goal is to minimize the total operational cost of an EMS organization while maintaining acceptable response times for a newly deﬁned EMS network that consists of supply centers, hospitals, responder locations, and incidents. We propose a new dispatch model, a deferred service model, to analyze the daily operations of ambulances that involve dispatch as needed and redeploy periodically. The main premise of this model is, given incident priority levels, incident demand patterns, and EMS provider resources, to decide which incidents to serve immediately and which incidents to defer to following periods while incurring deferral penalty costs. Additionally, high-priority incidents that are not addressed within the required response window incur delay penalty costs. Considering network size, ﬂeet size, incident patterns, and time-dependent parameters as different factors that may inﬂuence the solution, we compare the results in terms of service quality, response time, and total cost through extensive experimentation. Experimental results indicate that sending the closest ambulance to an incident site is not always the best choice.},

In this paper, we present a robust optimization approach to optimize both the location and routing of emergency response vehicles, accounting for uncertainty in travel times and spatial demand characteristic of LMICs. We traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely populated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the collection of two unique data sets that inform our approach. These data are leveraged to estimate demand for emergency medical services in an LMIC setting and to predict the travel time between any two locations in the road network for different times of day and days of the week. We combine our prediction-optimization framework with a simulation model and real data to provide an in-depth investigation into three policy-related questions. First, we demonstrate that outpost locations optimized for weekday rush hour lead to good performance for all times of day and days of the week. Second, we find that the performance of the current system could be replicated using one third of the current outpost locations and one half of the current number of ambulances. Finally, we show that a fleet of small ambulances has the potential to significantly outperform traditional ambulance vans. In particular, they are able to capture approximately three times more demand while reducing the median average response time by roughly 10\%–18\% over the entire week and 24\%–35\% during rush hour because of increased routing flexibility offered by more nimble vehicles on a larger road network. Our results provide practical insights for emergency response optimization that can be leveraged by hospital-based and private ambulance providers in Dhaka and other urban centers in developing countries.},

	abstract = {We consider a routing problem for ambulances in a disaster response scenario, in which a large number of injured people require medical aid at the same time. The ambulances are used to carry medical personnel and patients. We distinguish two groups of patients: slightly injured people who can be assisted directly in the field, and seriously injured people who have to be brought to hospitals. Since ambulances represent a scarce resource in disaster situations, their efficient usage is of the utmost importance. Two mathematical formulations are proposed to obtain route plans that minimize the latest service completion time among the people waiting for help. Since disaster response calls for high-quality solutions within seconds, we also propose a large neighborhood search metaheuristic. This solution approach can be applied at high frequency to cope with the dynamics and uncertainties in a disaster situation. Our experiments show that the metaheuristic produces high quality solutions for a large number of test instances within very short response time. Hence, it fulfills the criteria for applicability in a disaster situation. Within the experiments, we also analyzed the effect of various structural parameters of a problem, like the number of ambulances, hospitals, and the type of patients, on both running time of the heuristic and quality of the solutions.

To make up for this potential shortcoming, we show how to use direct search methods to tune the parameters in a value function approximation architecture so as to obtain high-quality policies. Direct search is computationally intensive. We therefore use a post-decision state dynamic programming formulation of ambulance redeployment that, together with direct search, requires far less computation with no noticeable performance loss.

	abstract = {Research on facility location is abundant. However, this research does not typically address the particular conditions that arise when locating facilities to service large-scale emergencies, such as earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc. In this work we ﬁrst survey general facility location problems and identify models used to address common emergency situations, such as house ﬁres and regular health care needs. We then analyze the characteristics of large-scale emergencies and propose a general facility location model that is suited for large-scale emergencies. This general facility location model can be cast as a covering model, a P-median model or a P-center model, each suited for different needs in a large-scale emergency. Illustrative examples are given to show how the proposed model can be used to optimize the locations of facilities for medical supplies to address large-scale emergencies in the Los Angeles area. Furthermore, comparison of the solutions obtained by respectively using the proposed model and the traditional model is given to show the beneﬁts of the proposed model in reducing loss of life and economic losses.},

Here, the importance of implementing temporary emergency management becomes clear. This study aims to locate some temporary emergency stations across the area by maximal covering after a disaster. Furthermore, a multi-mode fleet is used for transferring patients using different modes of transportation (e.g. helicopter ambulance and bus ambulance). Since the type of patients may change over periods, medical servers can displace among temporary emergency stations dynamically according to disaster severity. For this purpose, a new bi-objective dynamic location-helicopter ambulance allocation-ambulance routing model with multi-medical servers is presented. The first objective function minimizes the operational costs related to the newly designed Emergency Medical Service along with the rate of human loss. The second objective function minimizes the critical time spent before the medical treatment. To validate the developed model, the augmented e-constraint method is used and applied for the Tehran city, which shows the applicability of the model. Finally, two meta-heuristic algorithms are customized for large-sized problems, and the related results are compared based on multi-objective algorithms’ performance comparison metrics to find the more efficient one.},

Planning and preparedness are a set of activities in pre-disaster situations. When a disaster may not occur for a long time in a specific city, we cannot predict the time of its occurrence. However, in disaster situations, an EMS is faced with a large number of injured people, most of them with critical injuries, in which normal facilities and planning cannot respond. Last disasters teach us that we should be ready to respond correctly to decrease morbidity and mortality. This study seeks a better plan for patients in a post-disaster by categorizing them into very high emergency and normal patients. The main aim of the presented model is to find the best ambulance routing by minimizing the total response time, meanwhile finding the optimal number of a temporary emergency station and the best location setup by taking costs into consideration. The model is exactly solved by the ε-constraint method. Then, we can propose the optimal planning for the decision makers.},

The proposed model and algorithm are further verified in a real case study, and the numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. Specifically, we obtain several findings based on the computational results: (1) The best locations of ambulance stations should change in each period because the demand rate changes over time. (2) Involving temporary medical centers is necessary to reduce the average waiting time of injured people. (3) It may not be optimal to allocate ambulances from the nearest ambulance stations because of potentially limited station capacity.},

The allocation of emergency materials is of vital significance for saving lives and property losses and alleviating human suffering after disasters. Different from the traditional allocation model with single or double optimization objectives in one period, we focus on the objectives of three dimensions in humanitarian logistics: efficiency, effectiveness and equity. Finally, an emergency material allocation model with multi-rescue sites, multi-affected sites and multi-periods is proposed. The model allows decision makers to make trade-offs among efficiency, effectiveness and equity. Numerical experiments and real cases show that the model can adapt to large-scale emergency material distribution. The solution efficiency is high, and the optimal solution can be obtained in a few minutes. This satisfies the timeliness of emergency rescue distribution and provides decision makers with a quick distribution plan.},

This research formulates a multi-objective Mixed-Integer Non-Linear programming (MINLP) with uncertain parameters considering Relief Centers (RC), Demand Points (DP) in affected areas, transportation methods to deliver Relief Items (RI) and different types of RIs namely, perishable and imperishable. In pre-disaster stage, location and number of RCs with their prepositioned inventory level are determined. After disaster strikes, based on a distribution plan the amount of RIs that should be transported to DPs and number of needed vehicles are determined. The objective functions minimize the total distance traveled by RIs, total costs (including RC establish cost, inventory cost, fixed cost for each vehicle type and acquisition cost for RIs), maximum traveling time between RCs and DPs and number of perished items respectively. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software for small size test problems and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) as a meta-heuristic approach for large size problems. Numerical and computational results are provided to prove the efficiency and feasibility of the presented model. Finally, the developed model is implemented to Iran’s flood in 2019 as a case study.},

The paper presents a two-stage stochastic mixed integer program (SMIP) that provides an emergency response pre-positioning strategy for hurricanes or other disaster threats. The SMIP is a robust model that considers uncertainty in demand for the stocked supplies as well as uncertainty regarding transportation network availability after an event. Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a heuristic algorithm referred to as the Lagrangian L-shaped method (LLSM) is developed to solve large-scale instances of the problem. A case study focused on hurricane threat in the Gulf Coast area of the US illustrates application of the model.},
