abstract = {Production scheduling is a class of widely studied combinatorial optimization problems. Given the complexity of the most addressed production environments several solution procedures have been proposed. In recent years, operational researcher practitioners have been paying attention to solving production scheduling problems using constraint programming, and growing interest in this research domain has been evidenced. The aim of this study is to report a descriptive bibliometric analysis of applications of constraint programming in production scheduling problems. The scope of the study is limited to reviewing 170 scientific papers published between 1992 and 2023 from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. In our proposed research questions, we could address the main topics studied, the most studied performance measures, and the profile of the analyzed documents. Furthermore, we could identify the main gaps and present suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {In this paper, we show how the introduction of a new primitive constraint over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP allows us to find very good solutions for a large class of very difficult scheduling and placement problems. Examples on the cumulative scheduling problem, the 10 jobs × 10 machines problem, the perfect square problem, the strip packing problem and the incomparable rectangles packing problem are given, showing the versatility, the efficiency and the broad range of application of this new constraint. We point out that no other existing approach can address simultaneously all the problems discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {Waiting time and idle time are among the main cost sources in production systems. They can also affect the feasibility of operations from a technological perspective; hence, both such times have to be kept as small as possible. This paper studies four single-objective variants of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where two objectives are considered: the weighted sum of the makespan and the core waiting time, and the weighted sum of the makespan and the core idle time. For each objective, both the problem with the assumption of semi-active solution and the one without it are considered. A general solution framework for tackling the above-mentioned problems is provided. First, two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations (based on positional and precedence variables, respectively) and one Constraint Programming (CP) formulation are presented. Second, a MILP-based local search approach based on the positional MILP formulation and the concept of sliding windows are defined. An extensive set of computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the positional MILP formulation strongly outperforms the other two formulations in all the considered cases. The experiments also show that the sliding window local search heuristic achieves much better performances than other state-of-the-art local search heuristics. Indeed, it is able to improve the state-of-the-art in 2384 instances out of 2400.}

title="Constraint Programming for Flexible Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Repeated Jobs and Repeated Operations",
abstract="The manufacturing process relies heavily on production scheduling to guarantee effective production schedules, reduce costs and product shortages, and get away from delays, interruptions, and waste products. Scheduling issues have been effectively solved via constraint programming. In this paper, we consider a constraint programming formulation of the flexible flow shop scheduling problem with repeated jobs and operations repetitions. We also implemented seven fast heuristics and compared the results with the constraint programming solution. The results from using the CPLEX solver as a solution tool were satisfactory. Computational experiments demonstrate that using constraint programming can be significantly more advantageous than using heuristics.",
