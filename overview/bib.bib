abstract = {Production scheduling is a class of widely studied combinatorial optimization problems. Given the complexity of the most addressed production environments several solution procedures have been proposed. In recent years, operational researcher practitioners have been paying attention to solving production scheduling problems using constraint programming, and growing interest in this research domain has been evidenced. The aim of this study is to report a descriptive bibliometric analysis of applications of constraint programming in production scheduling problems. The scope of the study is limited to reviewing 170 scientific papers published between 1992 and 2023 from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. In our proposed research questions, we could address the main topics studied, the most studied performance measures, and the profile of the analyzed documents. Furthermore, we could identify the main gaps and present suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {In this paper, we show how the introduction of a new primitive constraint over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP allows us to find very good solutions for a large class of very difficult scheduling and placement problems. Examples on the cumulative scheduling problem, the 10 jobs × 10 machines problem, the perfect square problem, the strip packing problem and the incomparable rectangles packing problem are given, showing the versatility, the efficiency and the broad range of application of this new constraint. We point out that no other existing approach can address simultaneously all the problems discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {Waiting time and idle time are among the main cost sources in production systems. They can also affect the feasibility of operations from a technological perspective; hence, both such times have to be kept as small as possible. This paper studies four single-objective variants of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where two objectives are considered: the weighted sum of the makespan and the core waiting time, and the weighted sum of the makespan and the core idle time. For each objective, both the problem with the assumption of semi-active solution and the one without it are considered. A general solution framework for tackling the above-mentioned problems is provided. First, two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations (based on positional and precedence variables, respectively) and one Constraint Programming (CP) formulation are presented. Second, a MILP-based local search approach based on the positional MILP formulation and the concept of sliding windows are defined. An extensive set of computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the positional MILP formulation strongly outperforms the other two formulations in all the considered cases. The experiments also show that the sliding window local search heuristic achieves much better performances than other state-of-the-art local search heuristics. Indeed, it is able to improve the state-of-the-art in 2384 instances out of 2400.}

title="Constraint Programming for Flexible Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Repeated Jobs and Repeated Operations",
abstract="The manufacturing process relies heavily on production scheduling to guarantee effective production schedules, reduce costs and product shortages, and get away from delays, interruptions, and waste products. Scheduling issues have been effectively solved via constraint programming. In this paper, we consider a constraint programming formulation of the flexible flow shop scheduling problem with repeated jobs and operations repetitions. We also implemented seven fast heuristics and compared the results with the constraint programming solution. The results from using the CPLEX solver as a solution tool were satisfactory. Computational experiments demonstrate that using constraint programming can be significantly more advantageous than using heuristics.",

abstract = {In this paper, we present a constraint programming model for the routing and scheduling of trains running through a junction. The model uses input data from relevant time events of train runs calculated by a simulator. The model can be integrated into a decision support system used by operators who make decisions to change train routes or orders to avoid conflicts and delays. The model has been applied to a set of problem instances. This set has been defined from a real case study of traffic on the Pierrefitte-Gonesse node, North of Paris. Preliminary results show that the solution identified by the model yields a significant improvement in performance within an acceptable computation time.}

abstract="Scheduling problems come in all shapes and sizes, and no two problems are alike. However it is possible to abstract certain features which are common to whole classes of problems. Some of the features can be expressed as logical requirements on the solution, and can be mapped directly to constraints in logic programming Even within the logical framework there are features, like symmetry, and sheer problem size, which require some extension of the standard CLP approach to be solved in practice. Most scheduling problems, however, are not amenable to a precise, correct logical specification. For longer term scheduling only approximate times are required: to the nearest day or month perhaps. Moreover for both long term and short term scheduling the data input to the scheduler often turns out to be incorrect in practice due to unpredictable events like cancelled orders and machine breakdowns. Finally it is rarely possible, or sufficient, to find a single feasible schedule which satisfies a set of requirements. Instead an optimal schedule is sought, which may perhaps omit some jobs, but on balance meets the most possible requirements at the least overall cost.",

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how the introduction of new primitive constraints (e.g., among, diffn, cycle) over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP result in finding very rapidly good solutions for a large class of difficult sequencing, scheduling, geometrical placement and vehicle routing problems. The among constraint allows us to specify sequencing constraints in a very concise way. For the first time, the diffn constraint allows us to express and to solve directly multi-dimensional placement problems, where one has to consider nonoverlapping constraints between n-dimensional objects (e.g., rectangles, parallelepipeds). The cycle constraint makes it possible to specify a wide range of graph partitioning problems that could not yet be expressed by using current constraint logic programming languages. One of the main advantages of all these new primitives is to take into account more globally a set of elementary constraints. Finally, we point out that all the previous primitive constraints enhance the power of the CHIP system significantly, allowing us to solve real life problems that were not within reach of constraint technology before.}

  abstract={ Logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) is a substantial generalization of classical Benders decomposition that, in principle, allows the subproblem to be any optimization problem rather than specifically a linear or nonlinear programming problem. It is amenable to a wide variety of large-scale problems that decouple or otherwise simplify when certain decision variables are fixed. This chapter presents the basic theory of LBBD and explains how classical Benders decomposition is a special case. It also describes branch and check, a variant of LBBD that solves the master problem only once. It illustrates in detail how Benders cuts and subproblem relaxations can be developed for some planning and scheduling problems. It then describes the role of LBBD in three large-scale case studies. The chapter concludes with an extensive survey of the LBBD literature, organized by problem domain, to allow the reader to explore how Benders cuts have been developed for a wide range of applications.},

abstract="Boolean satisfiability solving is a powerful approach for testing the feasibility of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form. Nowadays, Boolean satisfiability solvers efficiently handle problems with millions of clauses and hundreds of thousands of Boolean variables. But still many combinatorial problems such as resource-constrained project scheduling are beyond their capabilities. However, hybrid solution approaches have recently been proposed for resource-constrained project scheduling with generalized precedence constraints (PS{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}temp{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}Cmax) that incorporate advanced Boolean satisfiability technology such as nogood learning and conflict-driven search. In this chapter, we present a generic exact method for PS{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}temp{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}Cmaxusing one of the most successful hybrid approaches called lazy clause generation. This approach combines constraint programming solving with Boolean satisfiability solving.",

abstract = {In this paper, a novel variant of the open shop scheduling problem where the jobs have sequence-dependent processing times is addressed. The performance measure considered is the minimization of the length of the schedule (makespan). This problem arises in several real-life settings and, particularly, our work is inspired in scheduling samples in a quality control laboratory where a series of tests have to be performed in different equipment – being irrelevant the order in which these tests are performed –, and the time required to perform the tests depends on the previous sample tested. For this problem, we compare the results of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with those from a Constraint Programming (CP) model specifically proposed for the problem, showing that the latter yields better results. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, in order to obtain good – but not necessarily optimal – solutions within reasonable computational effort, we propose a matheuristic consisting of an Iterated Greedy Algorithm hybridized with a reconstruction phase based in executing the CP model with a partial solution. The results of the computational experiments carried out on 160 instances based on established datasets show the ability of the matheuristic to solve large-sized instances, in contrast with exact (i.e. MILP and CP) models. Our proposal outperforms the most efficient approximate procedures from related problems that have been adapted to the problem under consideration. A subsequent statistical analysis is carried out to prove the statistical significance of these results.}
