abstract = {Production scheduling is a class of widely studied combinatorial optimization problems. Given the complexity of the most addressed production environments several solution procedures have been proposed. In recent years, operational researcher practitioners have been paying attention to solving production scheduling problems using constraint programming, and growing interest in this research domain has been evidenced. The aim of this study is to report a descriptive bibliometric analysis of applications of constraint programming in production scheduling problems. The scope of the study is limited to reviewing 170 scientific papers published between 1992 and 2023 from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. In our proposed research questions, we could address the main topics studied, the most studied performance measures, and the profile of the analyzed documents. Furthermore, we could identify the main gaps and present suggestions for future research.}

abstract = {In this paper, we show how the introduction of a new primitive constraint over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP allows us to find very good solutions for a large class of very difficult scheduling and placement problems. Examples on the cumulative scheduling problem, the 10 jobs × 10 machines problem, the perfect square problem, the strip packing problem and the incomparable rectangles packing problem are given, showing the versatility, the efficiency and the broad range of application of this new constraint. We point out that no other existing approach can address simultaneously all the problems discussed in this paper.}

abstract = {Waiting time and idle time are among the main cost sources in production systems. They can also affect the feasibility of operations from a technological perspective; hence, both such times have to be kept as small as possible. This paper studies four single-objective variants of the permutation flowshop scheduling problem, where two objectives are considered: the weighted sum of the makespan and the core waiting time, and the weighted sum of the makespan and the core idle time. For each objective, both the problem with the assumption of semi-active solution and the one without it are considered. A general solution framework for tackling the above-mentioned problems is provided. First, two Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations (based on positional and precedence variables, respectively) and one Constraint Programming (CP) formulation are presented. Second, a MILP-based local search approach based on the positional MILP formulation and the concept of sliding windows are defined. An extensive set of computational experiments on benchmark instances show that the positional MILP formulation strongly outperforms the other two formulations in all the considered cases. The experiments also show that the sliding window local search heuristic achieves much better performances than other state-of-the-art local search heuristics. Indeed, it is able to improve the state-of-the-art in 2384 instances out of 2400.}

title="Constraint Programming for Flexible Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Repeated Jobs and Repeated Operations",
abstract="The manufacturing process relies heavily on production scheduling to guarantee effective production schedules, reduce costs and product shortages, and get away from delays, interruptions, and waste products. Scheduling issues have been effectively solved via constraint programming. In this paper, we consider a constraint programming formulation of the flexible flow shop scheduling problem with repeated jobs and operations repetitions. We also implemented seven fast heuristics and compared the results with the constraint programming solution. The results from using the CPLEX solver as a solution tool were satisfactory. Computational experiments demonstrate that using constraint programming can be significantly more advantageous than using heuristics.",

abstract = {In this paper, we present a constraint programming model for the routing and scheduling of trains running through a junction. The model uses input data from relevant time events of train runs calculated by a simulator. The model can be integrated into a decision support system used by operators who make decisions to change train routes or orders to avoid conflicts and delays. The model has been applied to a set of problem instances. This set has been defined from a real case study of traffic on the Pierrefitte-Gonesse node, North of Paris. Preliminary results show that the solution identified by the model yields a significant improvement in performance within an acceptable computation time.}

abstract="Scheduling problems come in all shapes and sizes, and no two problems are alike. However it is possible to abstract certain features which are common to whole classes of problems. Some of the features can be expressed as logical requirements on the solution, and can be mapped directly to constraints in logic programming Even within the logical framework there are features, like symmetry, and sheer problem size, which require some extension of the standard CLP approach to be solved in practice. Most scheduling problems, however, are not amenable to a precise, correct logical specification. For longer term scheduling only approximate times are required: to the nearest day or month perhaps. Moreover for both long term and short term scheduling the data input to the scheduler often turns out to be incorrect in practice due to unpredictable events like cancelled orders and machine breakdowns. Finally it is rarely possible, or sufficient, to find a single feasible schedule which satisfies a set of requirements. Instead an optimal schedule is sought, which may perhaps omit some jobs, but on balance meets the most possible requirements at the least overall cost.",

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to show how the introduction of new primitive constraints (e.g., among, diffn, cycle) over finite domains in the constraint logic programming system CHIP result in finding very rapidly good solutions for a large class of difficult sequencing, scheduling, geometrical placement and vehicle routing problems. The among constraint allows us to specify sequencing constraints in a very concise way. For the first time, the diffn constraint allows us to express and to solve directly multi-dimensional placement problems, where one has to consider nonoverlapping constraints between n-dimensional objects (e.g., rectangles, parallelepipeds). The cycle constraint makes it possible to specify a wide range of graph partitioning problems that could not yet be expressed by using current constraint logic programming languages. One of the main advantages of all these new primitives is to take into account more globally a set of elementary constraints. Finally, we point out that all the previous primitive constraints enhance the power of the CHIP system significantly, allowing us to solve real life problems that were not within reach of constraint technology before.}

  abstract={ Logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) is a substantial generalization of classical Benders decomposition that, in principle, allows the subproblem to be any optimization problem rather than specifically a linear or nonlinear programming problem. It is amenable to a wide variety of large-scale problems that decouple or otherwise simplify when certain decision variables are fixed. This chapter presents the basic theory of LBBD and explains how classical Benders decomposition is a special case. It also describes branch and check, a variant of LBBD that solves the master problem only once. It illustrates in detail how Benders cuts and subproblem relaxations can be developed for some planning and scheduling problems. It then describes the role of LBBD in three large-scale case studies. The chapter concludes with an extensive survey of the LBBD literature, organized by problem domain, to allow the reader to explore how Benders cuts have been developed for a wide range of applications.},

abstract="Boolean satisfiability solving is a powerful approach for testing the feasibility of propositional logic formulae in conjunctive normal form. Nowadays, Boolean satisfiability solvers efficiently handle problems with millions of clauses and hundreds of thousands of Boolean variables. But still many combinatorial problems such as resource-constrained project scheduling are beyond their capabilities. However, hybrid solution approaches have recently been proposed for resource-constrained project scheduling with generalized precedence constraints (PS{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}temp{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}Cmax) that incorporate advanced Boolean satisfiability technology such as nogood learning and conflict-driven search. In this chapter, we present a generic exact method for PS{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}temp{\thinspace}|{\thinspace}Cmaxusing one of the most successful hybrid approaches called lazy clause generation. This approach combines constraint programming solving with Boolean satisfiability solving.",

abstract = {In this paper, a novel variant of the open shop scheduling problem where the jobs have sequence-dependent processing times is addressed. The performance measure considered is the minimization of the length of the schedule (makespan). This problem arises in several real-life settings and, particularly, our work is inspired in scheduling samples in a quality control laboratory where a series of tests have to be performed in different equipment – being irrelevant the order in which these tests are performed –, and the time required to perform the tests depends on the previous sample tested. For this problem, we compare the results of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model with those from a Constraint Programming (CP) model specifically proposed for the problem, showing that the latter yields better results. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, in order to obtain good – but not necessarily optimal – solutions within reasonable computational effort, we propose a matheuristic consisting of an Iterated Greedy Algorithm hybridized with a reconstruction phase based in executing the CP model with a partial solution. The results of the computational experiments carried out on 160 instances based on established datasets show the ability of the matheuristic to solve large-sized instances, in contrast with exact (i.e. MILP and CP) models. Our proposal outperforms the most efficient approximate procedures from related problems that have been adapted to the problem under consideration. A subsequent statistical analysis is carried out to prove the statistical significance of these results.}

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to help in the management of the operating
   theatre in order to improve its functionality. Our research focuses on
   the daily scheduling of the surgical acts in an operating theatre. We
   also take into account specific human and material constraints that
   indeed exist like, for example, the surgeon's preference for a specific
   operating room, a specific material or a specific team. However, it is
   obvious that the more the constraints, the more our problem will be
   complex to model and to solve. To solve this highly constrained
   scheduling problem, we take advantage of the constraint programming
   paradigm. Our constraint programming model optimizes the use of the
   operating theatre by minimizing the makespan, minimizing the overtime
   hours and maximizing the affinities between members of the surgical
   team. This model is instantiated on a real-life problem to present some
   results in this paper.},

Abstract = {Sports scheduling problems mainly consist in determining the date and
   the venue in which each game of a tournament will be played. Integer
   programming, constraint programming, metaheuristics, and hybrid methods
   have been successfully applied to the solution of different variants of
   this problem. This paper provides an introductory review of fundamental
   problems in sports scheduling and their formulations, followed by a
   survey of applications of optimization methods to scheduling problems in
   professional leagues of different sport disciplines such as football,
   baseball, basketball, cricket, and hockey. A case study illustrates a
   real-life application of integer programming to the schedule of the
   yearly Brazilian football tournament.},

Abstract = {Sports have worldwide appeal. Professional sport leagues involve
   significant investments in players. Events such as the Olympics Games,
   the Football World Cup and the major golf and tennis tournaments
   generate huge worldwide television audiences and many sports are
   multi-million dollar industries. A key aspect of sporting events is the
   ability to generate schedules that optimize logistic issues and that are
   seen as fair to all those who have an interest. This is not just
   restricted to generating the fixtures, but also to other areas such as
   assigning officials to the games in the competitions. This paper
   provides an annotated bibliography for sports scheduling articles. This
   area can be traced back over 40 years. It is noticeable that the number
   of papers has risen in recent years, demonstrating that scientific
   interest is increasing in this area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Sports scheduling has been an extremely active area of research over the
   past twenty years. One important reason for this is that the
   computational methods for creating playable sports schedules have
   improved enough to be useful to real sports leagues. A key aspect to
   these computational improvements has been the development of hybrid
   methods that combine two or more of integer programming, constraint
   programming, metaheuristics, or other core optimization approaches.
   While there is a broad range of models and applications in sports
   scheduling, there have been two main classes of problems studied: break
   minimization problems and travel minimization problems. I illustrate how
   hybrid methods can be used for these two problems, as well as provide
   some comments on other, lesser studied problems. I also give some
   directions for further research in this area.},

Abstract = {The Traveling Tournament Problem with Predefined Venues (TTPPV) is a
   practical problem arising from sports scheduling. We describe two
   different modeling approaches for this problem, each of which is
   suitable for different sizes of instance. The experimental results show
   that our modeling approaches lead to improved performance compared to
   previous techniques in terms of the number of feasible solutions and the
   optimal value. Furthermore, we present how to execute the models in
   parallel through data-level parallelism. The parallel versions do not
   only gain speedup but also attain significant improvement on optimal
   value since more subtrees are searched independently.},

Abstract = {Scheduling a sports tournament is a complex optimization problem, which
   requires a large number of hard constraints to satisfy. Despite the
   availability of several such constraints in the literature, there
   remains a gap since most of the new sports events pose their own unique
   set of requirements, and demand novel constraints. Specifically talking
   of the strictly time bound events, ensuring fairness between the
   different teams in terms of their rest days, traveling, and the number
   of successive games they play, becomes a difficult task to resolve, and
   demands attention. In this work, we present a similar situation with a
   recently played sports event, where a suboptimal schedule favored some
   of the sides more than the others. We introduce various competitive
   parameters to draw a fairness comparison between the sides and propose a
   weighting criterion to point out the sides that enjoyed this schedule
   more than the others. Furthermore, we use root mean squared error
   between an ideal schedule and the actual ones for each side to determine
   unfairness in the distribution of rest days across their entire
   schedules. The latter is crucial, since successively playing a large
   number of games may lead to sportsmen burnout, which must be prevented.},

Abstract = {Real sports scheduling problems are difficult to solve due to the
   variety of different constraints that might be imposed. Over the last
   decade, through the work of a number of researchers, it has become
   easier to solve round-robin tournament problems. These tournaments can
   then become building blocks for more complicated schedules. For example,
   we have worked extensively with Major League Baseball on creating
   ``what-if{''} schedules for various league formats. Success in providing
   those schedules has depended on breaking the schedule into easily
   solvable pieces. Integer programming and constraint programming methods
   each have their places in this approach, depending on the constraints
   and objective function.},

Abstract = {The social golfer problem (SGP) has received plenty of attention in
   constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) research as a standard benchmark
   for symmetry breaking. However, the constraint satisfaction approach has
   stagnated for solving larger SGP instances over the last decade. We
   improve the existing model of the SGP by introducing more constraints
   that effectively reduce the search space, particularly for instances of
   special form. Furthermore, we present a search space splitting method to
   solve the SGP in parallel through data-level parallelism. Our
   implementation of the presented techniques allows us to attain solutions
   for eight instances with maximized weeks, in which six of them were open
   instances for the constraint satisfaction approach, and two of them are
   computed for the first time. Besides, super-linear speedups are observed
   for all the instances solved in parallel.},

Abstract = {We studied a two-phase, preliminary and finals, tournament, which
   commonly adopted for non-professional sports. The round robin tournament
   in divisions is played in the preliminary phase, followed by one of the
   three variants, namely single elimination, double elimination, and round
   robin in the finals phase. The objective is to determine the required
   number of venues (tables or courts) subject to the least timeslots under
   the given format. We used a diagonal symmetric matrix to pair teams to
   games and to schedule games in timeslots for the round robin tournament.
   For the preliminary phase, we proposed a procedure to find the number of
   divisions and the number of teams in each division that minimize the
   total number of games and timeslots accordingly. For the finals phase,
   we determined the number of venues required in the least timeslots. We
   then formulated a constraint programming model based on the diagonal
   symmetric matrix for the round robin tournament. Finally, we provided
   suggestions for choosing the appropriate competition format. (c) 2013

Abstract = {We define the timetable constrained distance minimization problem
   (TCDMP) which is a sports scheduling problem applicable for tournaments
   where the total travel distance must be minimized. The problem consists
   of finding an optimal home-away assignment when the opponents of each
   team in each time slot are given. We present an integer programming, a
   constraint programming formulation and describe two alternative solution
   methods: a hybrid integer programming/constraint programming approach
   and a branch and price algorithm. We test all four solution methods on
   benchmark problems and compare the performance. Furthermore, we present
   a new heuristic solution method called the circular traveling salesman
   approach (CTSA) for solving the traveling tournament problem. The
   solution method is able to obtain high quality solutions almost
   instantaneously, and by applying the TCDMP, we show how the solutions
   can be further improved.},

Abstract = {This paper considers the separation in 2-period double round robin
   tournaments (2P-DRRTs) with minimum breaks. The separation is a lower
   bound on the number of slots between the two games with the same
   opponents. None of known schemes provides 2P-DRRTs with minimum breaks
   and a positive separation. We first propose a new scheme to generate
   2-separation 2P-DRRTs with minimum breaks, based on single round robin
   tournaments (SRRTs) with minimum breaks which have the last break in the
   third slot from the end. Our experiment results show that such SRRTs
   exist for 8-68 teams. Secondly, we consider maximizing the separation in
   general 2P-DRRTs with minimum breaks by integer programming and
   constraint programming, respectively. The two approaches of direct
   formulation and ``first-break, then-schedule{''} decomposition are
   presented and compared. We obtain the maximum separation for up to 14
   teams. Furthermore, we consider the application with place constraints
   to show the flexibility and efficiency of scheduling 2P-DRRTs with
   minimum breaks and a positive separation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   round robin schedule with a minimal number of breaks. Both mirrored and

   considered. The algorithm uses Benders cuts to obtain feasible home-away
   pattern sets in few iterations and this approach leads to significant
   reductions in computation time for hard instances. Furthermore, the
   algorithm is capable of solving a number of previously unsolved
   benchmark problems for the Traveling Tournament Problem with constant

Abstract = {A considerable number of sports competitions cope with limited
   availability of teams and sports infrastructure by organizing their
   timetable around a season that comprises many more time slots than games
   per team. However, in such timetables the rest period between teams'
   consecutive games can vary considerably and the difference in the number
   of games played at any point in the season can become large. In this
   paper, we propose an iterative two-phase approach to construct relaxed
   round-robin timetables that are less prone to these fairness issues. In
   particular, the first phase determines the game-off-day pattern (GOP)
   set which regulates when teams play (home or away) or have an off day
   (also called bye). Subsequently, the second phase constructs a
   compatible timetable which specifies the opponents and the home
   advantage of the games. If no compatible timetable exists, we generate
   one or more logic-based Benders cuts that rule out the infeasible GOP
   set in future iterations. We test the two-phase approach on a problem
   where feasibility of the timetable and the objective value is mainly
   determined by when teams play games and show that our approach excels
   when the number of additional time slots is moderate.},

abstract="Ant Colony Optimisation algorithms perform competitively with other meta-heuristics for many types of optimisation problems, but unfortunately their performance does not always degrade gracefully when the problem contains hard constraints. Many industrially relevant problems, such as fleet routing, rostering and timetabling, are typically subject to hard constraints. A complementary technique for solving combinatorial optimisation problems is Constraint Programming (CP). CP techniques are specialized for solving hard constraints, but they may be inefficient as an optimisation method if the feasible space is very large. A hybrid approach combining both techniques therefore holds the hope to combine these complementary advantages. The paper explores how such an integration can be achieved and presents a hybrid search method CPACS derived by embedding CP into ACS. We have tested CPACS on job scheduling problems. Initial benchmark results are encouraging and suggest that CPACS has the biggest advantage over the individual methods for problems of medium tightness, where the constraints cause a highly fragmented but still very large search space.",

abstract = {The job-shop scheduling issue is more and more described not only in terms of efficiency (e.g. Makespan), but also in terms of interactivity and practicability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the ability of two approaches inherited from artificial intelligence domain to contribute to the solving of this issue: Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) inherited from Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). This analysis is achieved through the use of two specific computerised tools: Constraint Handling In Prolog (CHIP) as a CLP software and the Distributed Production Scheduling System (DPSS) as a distributed problem solving system. These tools are then evaluated in terms of interactivity, efficiency and practicability. Interactivity is discussed according to qualitative points of view such as the ability to provide efficient decision support, a set of alternative solutions and the possibility to parameterise the algorithms. Efficiency is described in terms of optimality or sub-optimality by the analysis of the Makespan criterion vs. fixed computation time. Practicability is associated to the industrial viability of the methods: ability to cope with real industrial case study or ability to face real industrial contexts. Evaluation is then performed through a multiple criteria analysis. This analysis is achieved given an increasing number of operations to perform. The results highlight the high complementary level of these two approaches, allowing us to provide a framework for a joint integration, which shall be optimised when taking into account the assets of each approach according to the three evaluation criteria.}

Abstract = {Optimizing the daily operating room schedule can be problematic because
   of the many constraints that need to be taken into account, and solving
   this issue within a reasonable time span is difficult. The originality
   of the present study is the consideration of the surgical team's wishes
   in the establishment of an operating room schedule. To resolve the
   operating room scheduling problem, we took advantage of the ``expressive
   power{''} of the constraint programming paradigm to include multiple
   real-life constraints in our model, such as availability, staff
   preferences, and affinities among staff members. The aim of this
   research was to optimize use of the operating room by minimizing the
   makespan, minimizing overtime hours, and maximizing affinities among
   members of the surgical team. We developed a ``generic{''} model that
   includes most of the problems encountered in the literature as well as
   constraints apparent in our hospital. The results achieved when using
   this model in a real-life situation are presented at the end of the
   paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The planning of operating rooms under block strategy is addressed in
   this study. The decisions are about opening the operating rooms and
   assigning specialties and surgeons to blocks at the tactical level, and
   sequencing the surgeries at the operational level. This problem aims to
   minimize the costs of opening the operating rooms and their overtime,
   the waiting costs of patients, and the surgeons' idle costs. We propose
   two mixed integer linear programming models, a constraint programming
   (CP) model and a constraint programming-based column generation (CPCG)
   method for handling the problem. The performance of the models is
   evaluated by random test instances. The results indicate that CP and
   CPCG models are more efficient than the linear programming models in
   terms of computational time, and the number of variables and
   constraints. The proposed method CPCG generates optimal solutions for
   problem instances of up to 30 surgeries in less than 4 min. The CP model
   finds the optimal solutions in about one minute but proving the
   optimality of the found solutions is time-consuming in some instances.
   The maximum optimality gap for the proposed two-step linear programming
   model is 2\%, while its run time is less than 20 s. A sensitivity
   analysis is done on the main parameters of the problem like objectives'
   weights, opening cost of ORs, unit waiting cost of patients, and the
   maximum available time in surgery blocks. Among the three objectives,
   the unit waiting cost of patients has the most sensitivity to variations
   of the objective function weights.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents a new approach for sequencing of batches in a
   complex pipeline network by using Constraint Programming (CP)
   techniques. These batches are composed by oil derivatives to be
   transferred by the pipeline network. Although many papers found in the
   literature usually deal with reduced pipeline topologies, the network
   considered in this work is quite complex. It involves nine areas,
   including three refineries, one harbor and five distribution centers
   interconnected by fifteen multiproduct pipelines. Although this paper
   only focus on sequencing of batches, the final task is to provide a
   complete transfer scheduling for the pipeline network. This scheduling
   is accomplished by means of three key elements: assignment, sequencing
   and timing. The proposed CP model considered for sequencing of batches
   introduces particular features of the problem that can be used by
   specialized solvers. This approach aims to consider time delays
   introduced by the pipeline network during product transfers. Preliminary
   results show that a suitable ordering of batches can be obtained for
   improving inventory levels. Besides, results show a better performance
   when compared to a heuristic approach which can fail for some particular
   cases.},

Abstract = {This article applies Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) for the

   This network is located in southeast Brazil and involves refineries,

   sizes, many of them with various kilometers long. The solution of
   pipeline-scheduling problems poses significant computational challenges.
   A decomposition framework is used for modeling and solving purposes. The
   proposed CLP solution approach is used for the combinatorial task of
   sequencing the operational batches, taking into account a series of
   operational constraints that are detailed modeled. In particular, the
   inclusion of plug products is avoided and the minimization of reversion
   on flow direction of pipelines is taken into account. Tests were

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of developing all optimization
   structure to aid the operational decision-making in a real-world
   pipeline scenario. The pipeline connects an inland refinery to a harbor,
   conveying different types of commodities (gasoline, diesel, kerosene,
   alcohol, liquefied petroleum gas, etc). The scheduling of activities has
   to be specified in advance by a specialist, who must provide low cost
   operational procedures. The specialist has to take into account issues
   concerning product availability, tankage constraints, pumping
   sequencing, flow rate determination, and a series of operational
   requirements. Thus, the decision-making process is hard and error-prone,
   and the developed optimization structure call aid the specialist to
   determine the pipeline scheduling with improved efficiency. Such
   optimization structure has its core ill a novel mathematical approach,
   which uses Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and Mixed Integer Linear
   Programming (MILP) in an integrated CLP-MILP model. Moreover, a set of
   high-level modeling structures was created to straightforward formulate
   the CLP-MTLP model. The scheme used for integrating techniques is double
   modeling (Hooker, 2000), and the CLP-MILP model is implemented and
   solved by using a commercial tool. Illustrative instances have
   demonstrated that the optimization structure is able to define new
   operational points to the pipeline system., providing significant cost
   saving.},

abstract = {Planning, scheduling and constraint satisfaction are important areas in artificial intelligence (AI). Many real-world problems are known as AI planning and scheduling problems, where resources must be allocated so as to optimize overall performance objectives. Therefore, solving these problems requires an adequate mixture of planning, scheduling and resource allocation to competing goal activities over time in the presence of complex state-dependent constraints. Constraint satisfaction plays also an important role to solve real-life problems, so that integrated techniques that manage planning and scheduling with constraint satisfaction remains necessary. This special issue on Planning, Scheduling and Constraint Satisfaction compiles a selection of papers of CAEPIA’2007 workshop on Planning, Scheduling and Constraint Satisfaction and COPLAS’2007: CP/ICAPS 2007 Joint Workshop on Constraint Satisfaction Techniques for Planning and Scheduling Problems. This issue presents novel advances on planning, scheduling, constraint programming/constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and many other common areas that exist among them. On the whole, this issue mainly focus on managing complex problems where planning, scheduling, constraint satisfaction and search must be combined and/or interrelated, which entails an enormous potential for practical applications and future research. Furthermore, this issue also includes a complete survey about constraint satisfaction, planning, scheduling and integration among these areas.},

  abstract={ This paper proposes a hybrid programming framework for modeling and solving of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and constraint optimization problems (COPs). Two paradigms, CLP (constraint logic programming) and MP (mathematical programming), are integrated in the framework. The integration is supplemented with the original method of problem transformation, used in the framework as a presolving method. The transformation substantially reduces the feasible solution space. The framework automatically generates CSP and COP models based on current values of data instances, questions asked by a user, and set of predicates and facts of the problem being modeled, which altogether constitute a knowledge database for the given problem. This dynamic generation of dedicated models, based on the knowledge base, together with the parameters changing externally, for example, the user’s questions, is the implementation of the autonomous search concept. The models are solved using the internal or external solvers integrated with the framework. The architecture of the framework as well as its implementation outline is also included in the paper. The effectiveness of the framework regarding the modeling and solution search is assessed through the illustrative examples relating to scheduling problems with additional constrained resources. },

  abstract={ In this paper, we are discussing a research project aiming to optimize the scheduling of production orders within a real application in the packaging field. As a first approach, we model the problem as an extended version of the hybrid and flexible flowshop scheduling problem with precedence constraints, parallel machines, and sequence-dependent setups. The optimization objective considered is the minimization of the total tardiness. To tackle this problem, we use two methodologies: mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and constraint programming (CP). These two models were further extended by adding resource calendar constraints named also availability constraints; this implies that the tasks should be scheduled only when the machine is available. The different proposed models were compared to each other on a set of generated benchmarks that reflect the specific properties of the industrial partner. Finally, as the studied configuration relies on practical real-world application, where thousands of orders are produced monthly, a novel dedicated heuristic was designed to address the need for quick solutions. The latter outperforms the other proposed algorithms for expected total tardiness minimization. The proposed problem can be readily modified to suit a wide range of real-world situations involving the scheduling of activities that share similar characteristics. },

Nous proposons de modéliser notre problème en tant que problème de satisfaction de contraintes ou CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem). Mettre en œuvre ce modèle utilise un environnement de Programmation logique avec contraintes (Constraint Logic Programming environment).

In this article, we develop a constraint propagation algorithm for the calculation of lower bounds on the number and size of tasks necessary to satisfy given demand. These bounds are then used to express four types of valid inequalities which greatly enhance the computational performance of the MIP scheduling model. Specifically, the addition of these inequalities leads to reductions in the computational requirements of more than three orders of magnitude, thereby allowing us to address medium‐sized problems of industrial relevance. Importantly, the proposed methods are applicable to a wide range of problem classes and time‐indexed MIP models for chemical production scheduling. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers  AIChE J , 59:872‐887, 2013 },

Design/methodology/approach  The model is based on the constraint programming (CP) framework; it integrates multiple scheduling characteristics of repetitive activities such as continuous or fragmented execution, atypical activities and coexistence of different modes in an activity. To improve project performance while avoiding inefficient hiring and firing conditions, the strategy of bidirectional acceleration is presented and implemented, which requires keeping regular changes in the execution modes between successive subactivities in the same activity.    Findings  Two case studies involving a real residential building construction project and a hotel refurbishing project are used to demonstrate the application of the proposed model based on four different scenarios. The results show that (1) the CP model has great advantages in terms of solving speed and solution quality than its equivalent mathematical model, (2) higher project performance can be obtained compared to using previously developed models and (3) the model can be easily replicated or even modified to enable multicrew implementation.    Originality/value  The original contribution of this research is presenting a novel CP-based repetitive scheduling optimization model to solve the multimode resource-constrained time-cost tradeoff problem of repetitive projects. The model has the capability of minimizing the project total cost that is composed of direct costs, indirect costs, early completion incentives and late completion penalties.  },

In this work, we introduce an innovative scheduling system that allows the efficient and flexible generation of schedules for TLSP. It features a new Constraint Programming model that covers both the grouping and the scheduling aspect, as well as a hybrid Very Large Neighborhood Search that internally uses the CP model. Our experimental results on generated and real-world benchmark instances show that good results can be obtained even compared to settings which have a good grouping already provided, including several new best known solutions for these instances. Our algorithms for TLSP have been successfully implemented in a real-world industrial test laboratory. We provide a detailed description of the deployed system as well as additional useful soft constraints supported by the solvers and general lessons learned. This includes a discussion of the choice of soft constraint weights, with an analysis on the impact and relation of different objectives to each other. Our experiments show that some soft constraints complement each other well, while others require explicit trade-offs via their relative weights.

  abstract={ Abstract  The objective of Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) is to find the proper assignment of tasks to workstations, taking into consideration various types of constraints and defined management goals. Early research in the field focused on solving the Simple Assembly Line Balancing problem, a basic simplified version of the general problem. As the production environment became more complex, several new ALB problem types appeared, and almost all ALB problems are NP-hard, meaning that finding a solution requires a lot of time, resources, and computational power. Methods with custom-made algorithms and generic approaches have been developed for solving these problems. While custom-made algorithms are generally more efficient, generic approaches can be more easily extended to cover other variations of the problem. Over the past few decades, automation has played an increasingly important role in various operations, although complete automation is often not possible. As a result, there is a growing need for partially automated assembly line balancing models. In these circumstances, the flexibility of a generic approach is essential. This paper compares two generic approaches: mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and constraint programming (CP), for two types of partially automated assembly line balancing problems. While CP is relatively slower in solving the simpler allocation problems, it is more efficient than MILP when an increased number of constraints is applied to the ALB and an allocation and scheduling problem needs to be solved. },

  abstract={ When a natural disaster occurs, road maintenance departments always face the challenge of how to assign repair resources properly to recover damaged road segments as soon as possible. From the literature review, most studies treat such problems as a vehicle routing problem (VRP). In those studies, repair resources are always dispatched as complete crews, and cannot be divided into smaller scales. Furthermore, each disaster point is only allowed one group of resources to recover it, without considering the possibility of accelerating the production rate subjected to specific objectives. Such limitation restricts required resources in an inflexible manner. Therefore, this study defines all repair works as an emergency repair project and adopts the framework of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP), which can resolve such complicated resource assignment issue. A novel emergency repair scheduling model for the road network is proposed based on Constraint Programming (CP) as the searching algorithm to facilitate model formulation. According to the RCPSP concepts, disaster points are set as repair activities and resource travel routes between disaster points are set as transit activities. All the repair activities are linked by transit activities and the required resources are assigned accordingly. In order to consider the second-wave hazard events of where new disaster points may occur, and new resources may be added into emergency repair projects, a rescheduling feature is integrated into the proposed model. Through two case studies, research findings show that this model can be easily modulated to adapt to different situations satisfying practical disaster management goals and solving emergency repair scheduling problems for road networks efficiently. },

  abstract={ As bridge infrastructure ages, the deterioration of materials and hazard events reduce the service quality and compromise the safety of the structure. Therefore, there is a tremendous need for bridge maintenance planning, and such maintenance studies during recent years have focused on the life cycle aspect. To fulfill the budget requirements of life cycle maintenance, an important issue is to ensure that the limited maintenance budget is utilized in an effective way. However, there are few studies that have aimed to assess the topic of budget allocation and the adjustment of bridge life-cycle maintenance issues. In order to resolve such issues, a two-stage optimization model based on constraint programming (CP) is proposed in this study to deal with maintenance scheduling problems. This is facilitated by adopting the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) framework, in which, three plans according to the maintenance time point are considered (i.e., early, middle, and late plans). According to the RCPSP concepts, this study views the budget ceiling as the resource limit, and maintenance plans as activities, so that the feasibility of each maintenance plan depends on the sufficiency of the budget. As the first stage, Model-I (the life cycle lifespan evaluation model) takes a life cycle perspective, evaluating how long it will take to keep all bridges in a serviceable condition with minimum expenditure over the planning cycle, and evaluates the annual budgets that can be used as a reference for users to draft a budget plan. Based on the planning result from Model-I and the actual annual budget approved for the current year, the second stage, Model-II (the annual budget allocation model) then reallocates the actual budget to take into account the importance of all bridges and different costs and benefits of maintenance plans, and revises the suggested annual budget values obtained by Model-I for the following years. Through a case study, the optimized result demonstrates that annual recursive implementation of this two-stage model satisfies the need to adjust existing budgetary data, and provides management personnel with optimized and realistic maintenance decision support for bridge infrastructure. },

  abstract={ Abstract  Scheduling methods are important for effective production and logistics management, where tasks need to be allocated and performed with limited resources. In particular, the Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. Given that already moderately sized JSP instances can be highly combinatorial, and neither optimal schedules nor the runtime to termination of complete optimization methods is known, efficient approaches to approximate good-quality schedules are of interest. In this paper, we propose problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations so that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. Regarding the feasibility and quality of solutions, problem decomposition must respect the precedence of operations within their jobs and partial schedules optimized by time windows should yield better global solutions than obtainable in similar runtime on the entire instance. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract window-wise optimization limitations restricted to partial schedules. Our experiments on JSP benchmark sets of several sizes show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within the runtime limit than global optimization on the full problem, where the gap increases with the number of operations to schedule. While the obtained solution quality still remains behind a state-of-the-art Constraint Programming system, our multi-shot solving approach comes closer the larger the instance size, demonstrating good scalability by problem decomposition. },

Typical of such problems is the minimization of the completion time of projects of the PERT/CPM variety where limits on resource availability force the postponement of selected activities during project performance. Also included in this class of problems for which our procedure is applicable is the assignment of jobs to machines such that the elapsed time for completing all jobs (makespan) is a minimum over all possible job-machine assignments.    The procedure developed consists of a systematic evaluation (enumeration) of all possible job finish times for each task in the project. To limit the number of task assignments which have to be explicitly evaluated, an artifice called a network cut is developed which removes from consideration the evaluation of job finish times which cannot lead to a reduced project completion time. Results reported demonstrate that the procedure developed is a reliable optimization technique for projects consisting of up to 30–50 jobs and three different resource types. The procedure is particularly applicable in those instances in which computer primary storage is limited. Many of the mini-computers available today are capable of implementing our approach without extensive programming being required for writing to auxiliary storage, making the technique available to the project manager in those environments in which extensive computer resources for scheduling are not readily available.  },

This is achieved separating the complex yet classical parallel machines scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times from the additional human resources planning problem: the former is formulated and solved through constraint programming, while an ad hoc procedure is provided for the latter.

This paper studies flexible job shop scheduling problems with arbitrary precedence graphs. Rigorous mixed integer and constraint programming models are presented, as well as an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to solve large‐scale problems. The proposed heuristic solution framework is equipped with efficient evolution and local search mechanisms as well as new feasibility detection and makespan estimation methods. To that end, new theorems are derived that extend previous theoretical contributions of the literature. Computational experiments on existing benchmark datasets show that the proposed solution methods outperform the current state‐of‐the‐art. Overall, 59 new best solutions and 61 new lower bounds are produced for a total of 228 benchmark problem instances of the literature. To explore the impact of the arbitrary precedence graphs, lower bounds and heuristic solutions are generated for new large‐scale problems. These experiments illustrate that the machine assignment flexibility and density of the precedence graphs, affect not only the makespan, but also the difficulty of producing good upper bounds.  },

The availability of a resource is depleted and replenished at the occurrence times of a set of events. The decision problem of ERCPSP consists of determining whether an instance has a feasible schedule or not. When there is only one nonrenewable resource, this problem is equivalent to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the number of resource units initially required. It generalizes the maximum cumulative cost problem and the two-machine maximum completion time flow-shop problem. In this paper, we consider this problem with some specific precedence constraints: parallel chains, series-parallel and interval order precedence constraints. For the first two cases, polynomial algorithms based on a linear decomposition of chains are proposed. For the third case, a polynomial algorithm is introduced to solve it. The priority between events is defined using the properties of interval orders. },

In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing body of knowledge on ML for Constraint Programming (CP), which learns from problem instances. Second, we introduce a boundary estimation framework that is applied as a tool to support a CP solver. Within this framework, different ML models are discussed and evaluated regarding their suitability for boundary estimation, and countermeasures to avoid unfeasible estimations that avoid the solver finding an optimal solution are shown. Third, we present an experimental study with distinct CP solvers on seven COPs. Our results show that near-optimal boundaries can be learned for these COPs with only little overhead. These estimated boundaries reduce the objective domain size by 60-88% and can help the solver find near-optimal solutions early during the search. },

  abstract={ Machine scheduling is a hard combinatorial problem having many manifestations in real life. Due to the schedule followed, the possibility of installations of machines operating sub-optimally is high. In this work, we examine the problem of a single machine with time-dependent capacity that performs jobs of deterministic durations, while for each job, its due time is known in advance. The objective is to minimize the aggregated tardiness in all tasks. The problem was motivated by the need to schedule charging times of electric vehicles effectively. We formulate an integer programming model that clearly describes the problem and a constraint programming model capable of effectively solving it. Due to the usage of interval variables, global constraints, a powerful constraint programming solver, and a heuristic we have identified, which we call the “due times rule”, the constraint programming model can reach excellent solutions. Furthermore, we employ a hybrid approach that exploits three local search improvement procedures in a schema where the constraint programming part of the solver plays a central role. These improvement procedures exhaustively enumerate portions of the search space by exchanging consecutive jobs with a single job of the same duration, moving cost-incurring jobs to earlier times in a consecutive sequence of jobs or even exploiting periods where capacity is not fully utilized to rearrange jobs. On the other hand, subproblems are given to the exact constraint programming solver, allowing freedom of movement only to certain parts of the schedule, either in vertical ribbons of the time axis or in groups of consecutive sequences of jobs. Experiments on publicly available data show that our approach is highly competitive and achieves the new best results in many problem instances. },

In fact, sub-tasks of unit-time length and predefined size are aggregated to composite tasks that have to be scheduled without preemption, but subject to flexibility concerning resource allocation. This setting most closely resembles the problem of malleable task scheduling, with sub-tasks being the smallest atomic unit of allocation. The specific type of malleability is realized using precedence constraints with minimum and maximum time lags. A bin packing model is established for this scheduling problem and a corresponding, dedicated branch-and-bound algorithm is devised, alongside problem-specific bound tightening, symmetry breaking and dominance concepts. The efficacy of the solution approach is demonstrated based on extensive computational experiments, including randomized instances, adapted benchmark instances from the literature, and a small real-world data set. In comparison to mixed-integer and constraint programming formulations, the new method is able to achieve a considerably higher percentage of optimal solutions at computation times that are up to orders of magnitude smaller. },

In addition, we propose a partial filtering algorithm that relies on a specific decomposition of the constraint and a novel extension of MDD filtering to node domains. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our proposed filtering algorithm, and demonstrate that the strength of the MDD propagation increases as the maximum width is increased. In particular, MDD propagation can outperform conventional domain propagation for Sequence by reducing the search tree size and solving time by several orders of magnitude.

        Existing ship scheduling approaches either ignore constraints on ship draft (distance between the waterline and the keel), or model these in very simple ways, such as a constant draft limit that does not change with time. However, in most ports the draft restriction changes over time due to variation in environmental conditions. More accurate consideration of draft constraints would allow more cargo to be scheduled for transport on the same set of ships. We present constraint programming (CP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) models for the problem of scheduling ships at a port with time-varying draft constraints so as to optimise cargo throughput at the port. We also investigate the effect of several variations to the CP model, including a model containing sequence variables, and a model with ordered inputs. Our model allows us to solve realistic instances of the problem to optimality in a very short time, and produces better schedules than both scheduling with constant draft, and manual scheduling approaches used in practice at ports.

  abstract={  Fast-tracking is an important process to speed the delivery of construction projects. To support optimum fast-tracking decisions, this paper introduces a generic schedule optimization framework that integrates four schedule acceleration dimensions: linear activity crashing; discrete activity modes of execution; alternative network paths; and flexible activity overlapping. Because excessive schedule compression can lead to space congestion and overstressed workers, the optimization formulation uses specific variables and constraints to prevent simultaneous use of overlapping and crashing at the same activity segment. To handle complex projects with a variety of milestones, resource limits, and constraints, the framework has been implemented using the constraint programming (CP) technique. Comparison with a literature case study and further experimentation demonstrated the flexibility and superior performance of the proposed model. The novelty of the model stems from its integrated multi-dimensional formulation, its CP engine, and its ability to provide alternative fast-track schedules to strictly constrained projects without overstressing the construction workers.  },

            This article introduces a combinatorial optimization approach to register allocation and instruction scheduling, two central compiler problems. Combinatorial optimization has the potential to solve these problems optimally and to exploit processor-specific features readily. Our approach is the first to leverage this potential
             in practice 
            : it captures the
             complete 
            set of program transformations used in state-of-the-art compilers,
             scales 
            to medium-sized functions of up to 1,000 instructions, and generates
             executable 
            code. This level of practicality is reached by using constraint programming, a particularly suitable combinatorial optimization technique. Unison, the implementation of our approach, is open source, used in industry, and integrated with the LLVM toolchain.
           
           An extensive evaluation confirms that Unison generates better code than LLVM while scaling to medium-sized functions. The evaluation uses systematically selected benchmarks from MediaBench and SPEC CPU2006 and different processor architectures (Hexagon, ARM, MIPS). Mean estimated speedup ranges from 1.1% to 10% and mean code size reduction ranges from 1.3% to 3.8% for the different architectures. A significant part of this improvement is due to the integrated nature of the approach. Executing the generated code on Hexagon confirms that the estimated speedup results in actual speedup. Given a fixed time limit, Unison solves optimally functions of up to 946 instructions, nearly an order of magnitude larger than previous approaches. 
           The results show that our combinatorial approach can be applied in practice to trade compilation time for code quality beyond the usual compiler optimization levels, identify improvement opportunities in heuristic algorithms, and fully exploit processor-specific features. },

We segregate patients according to their patterns of flow through a multi-stage perioperative system and use characteristics of surgery type and surgeon booking times to predict time intervals for patient procedures and subsequent recoveries. Working with a hospital in which 50+ procedures are performed in 15+ ORs most weekdays, we develop a constraint programming (CP) model that takes the hospital’s elective surgery pre-schedule as input and produces a recommended alternate schedule designed to minimize the expected peak number of patients in the PACU over the course of the day. Our model was developed from the hospital’s data and evaluated through its application to daily schedules during a testing period. Schedules generated by our model indicated the potential to reduce the peak PACU load substantially, 20-30% during most days in our study period, or alternatively reduce average patient flow time by up to 15% given the same PACU peak load. We also developed tools for schedule visualization that can be used to aid management both before and after surgery day; plan PACU resources; propose critical schedule changes; identify the timing, location, and root causes of delay; and to discern the differences in surgical specialty case mixes and their potential impacts on the system. This work is especially timely given high surgical wait times in Ontario which even got worse due to the COVID-19 pandemic. },

  abstract={  We solve the type-2 assembly line balancing problem in the presence of sequence-dependent setup times, denoted SUALBP-2. The problem consists of a set of tasks of a product, requiring to be processed in different assembly stations. Each task has a definite processing and setup times. The magnitude of setup times for each task is dependent on the processing sequence within each station. Processing and setup times of tasks assigned to each station constitute the station time. The goal is to minimize the cycle time (the maximum station time) by optimally (i) assigning tasks to assembly stations and (ii) sequencing these tasks within each station. To solve this challenging optimization problem, we first improve upon an existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) model by our proposed lower and upper bounds. These enhancements reduce the MIP model’s (solved CPLEX) average optimality gap from 41.61% to 20.77% on extra-large instances of the problem. To further overcome the intractability of the MIP model, we develop an exact logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) algorithm. The LBBD algorithm effectively incorporates a novel two-phase solution approach, the lower and upper bounds, various preprocessing techniques, relaxations, and valid inequalities. Using existing benchmarks in the literature, we demonstrate that our LBBD algorithm finds integer feasible solutions for 100% of all 788 instances (64% for the MIP), verifies optimality for 47% of instances (37% for the MIP), and achieves an average optimality gap of 5.04% (7.72% for the MIP obtained over 64% solved small instances). The LBBD algorithm also significantly reduces the computational time required to solve these benchmarks.    Summary of Contribution: Assembly line balancing plays a crucial role in productivity enhancement in manufacturing and service companies. A balanced assembly line ensures higher throughput rate and fairer distribution of workload among assembly stations (workers). Assembly line balancing, in its simplest form, is one of the most challenging combinatorial optimization problems. Its complexity is further intensified when the sequence of executing tasks assigned to each station influences the magnitude of the setup performed between any two successive tasks. In view of such complexity, most assembly line balancing problems have been solved by randomized search techniques that do not provide any guarantee on the quality of solutions found. The mission of this paper is to understand whether there is any special structure within the existing mathematical models in the literature and, if so, exploit them toward developing computationally efficient exact techniques that can provide guarantee on the quality of solutions. Indeed, we demonstrate that such a special mathematical structure exists and we thus develop the first decomposition technique in form of a logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD) to efficiently solve the type-2 sequence-dependent assembly line balancing problem. Specifically, we show that our LBBD significantly reduces cycle time and the time required for decision making. Our LBBD generalizes the scope of exact techniques for decision-making beyond the assembly line problems and is extendable to many other shop scheduling problems that arrange their stations (machines) serially and there are sequence-dependent setup times among their tasks.  },

  abstract={ 
 Purpose 
 The purpose of this paper is the need to build a novel approach that would allow flexible modeling and solving of food supply chain management (FSCM) problems. The models developed would use the data (data-driven modeling) as early as possible at the modeling phase, which would lead to a better and more realistic representation of the problems being modeled. 
 
 
 Design/methodology/approach 
 An essential feature of the presented approach is its declarativeness. The use of a declarative approach that additionally includes constraint satisfaction problems and provides an opportunity of fast and easy modeling of constrains different in type and character. Implementation of the proposed approach was performed with the use of an original hybrid method in which constraint logic programming (CLP) and mathematical programming (MP) are integrated and transformation of a model is used as a presolving technique. 
 
 
 Findings 
 The proposed constraint-driven approach has proved to be extremely flexible and efficient. The findings obtained during part of experiments dedicated to efficiency were very interesting. The use of the constraint-driven approach has enabled finding a solution depending on the instance data up to 1,000 times faster than using the MP. 
 
 
 Research limitations/implications 
 Due to the limited use of exact methods for NP-hard problems, the future study should be to integrate the CLP with environments other than the MP. It is also possible, e.g., with metaheuristics like genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, etc. 
 
 
 Practical implications 
 There is a possibility of using the approach as a basis to build a decision support system for FSCM, simple integration with databases, enterprise resource planning systems, management information systems, etc. 
 
 
 Originality/value 
 The new constraint-driven approach to FSCM has been proposed. The proposed approach is an extension of the hybrid approach. Also, a new decision-making model of distribution and logistics for the food supply chain is built. A presolving technique for this model has been presented.

  abstract={  This paper considers the multimode resource-constrained project-scheduling problem (MRCPSP) with a minimum-makespan objective. An exact branch and cut algorithm is presented based on the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem. In the preprocessing stage, lower bounds on the distance between each pair of precedence-constrained activities are derived. These bounds are used to reduce the number of variables in the model and to generate cuts that tighten the linear programming relaxation. The solution process is accelerated by an adaptive branching scheme in conjunction with a bound-tightening scheme that is called iteratively after branching. To find good feasible solutions in the early stages of the computations, a high-level neighborhood search strategy known as local branching is included. Here, a neighborhood of a feasible solution is defined by the linear inequalities in the ILP model and is searched first. As implemented, the full algorithm is exact rather than heuristic in nature. Numerical results are reported for 20- and 30-activity benchmark problems. These are the largest instances available and are generally viewed to be notoriously difficult. Up until now, there were no confirmed optimal solutions for any of the 552 30-activity instances. We were able to find several better solutions and to show that at least 506 are optimal.  },

In contrast to time-indexed models, the size of event-based models does not depend on the time horizon. For two event-based models OOE and SEE introduced by Koné et al. (Comput Oper Res 38(1):3–13, 2011), we first present new valid inequalities that strengthen the original formulation. Furthermore, we state a new event-based model, the  Interval Event-Based Model  (IEE), and deduce natural linear transformations between all three models. Those transformations yield the strict domination order    $$IEE \succ SEE \succ OOE$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>≻</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>   for their respective linear programming relaxations, meaning that the new IEE model has the strongest linear relaxation among all known event-based models. In addition, we show that DDT can be retrieved from IEE by subsequent expansion and projection of the underlying solution space. This yields a unified polyhedral view on a complete branch of MIP models for the RCPSP. Finally, we also compare the computational performance between all models on common test instances of the PSPLIB (Kolisch and Sprecher in Eur J Oper Res 96(1):205–216, 1997). },

This study proposed a constraint programming approach, a novel heuristic based on a priority rule, and Tabu search procedures to tackle this optimization problem. The constraint programming model, implemented using a commercial solver, serves as the exact resolution method, while the heuristic and Tabu search explore approximate solutions simultaneously. The motivation behind this research is the need to address the complexities of scheduling problems in the context of two-stage hybrid flowshop with dedicated machines. This problem presents significant challenges due to its NP-hard nature and the need for efficient optimization techniques. The contribution of this study lies in the development of an integrated approach that combines constraint programming, a novel heuristic, and Tabu search to provide a comprehensive and efficient solution. The proposed constraint programming model offers exact resolution capabilities, while the heuristic and Tabu search provide approximate solutions, offering a balance between accuracy and efficiency. To enhance the search process, the research introduces effective elimination rules, which reduce the search space and simplify the search effort. This approach improves the overall optimization performance and contributes to finding high-quality solutions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The heuristic approach achieves complete success in solving all instances for specific classes, showcasing its practical applicability. Furthermore, the constraint programming model exhibits exceptional efficiency, successfully solving problems with up to n=500 jobs. This efficiency is noteworthy compared to instances solved by other exact solution approaches, indicating the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed method. },

The BOM structures and processing parameters of the products vary greatly, making it difficult for a single shop to meet such a wide range of processing parameters. For the dynamic and fuzzy manufacturing characteristics of the products, not only the coordinated transport time of multiple shops but also the fact that the product has a designated output shop should be considered. In order to solve such Multi-shop Integrated Scheduling Problem with Fixed Output Constraint (MISP-FOC), a constraint programming model is developed to minimize the total tardiness, and then a Multi-shop Integrated Scheduling Algorithm (MISA) based on EGA (Enhanced Genetic Algorithm) and B&amp;B (Branch and Bound) is proposed. MISA is a hybrid optimization method and consists of four parts. Firstly, to deal with the dynamic and fuzzy manufacturing characteristics, the dynamic production process is transformed into a series of time-continuous static scheduling problem according to the proposed dynamic rescheduling mechanism. Secondly, the pre-scheduling scheme is generated by the EGA at each event moment. Thirdly, the jobs in the pre-scheduling scheme are divided into three parts, namely, dispatched jobs, jobs to be dispatched, and jobs available for rescheduling, and at last, the B&amp;B method is used to optimize the jobs available for rescheduling by utilizing the period when the dispatched jobs are in execution. Google OR-Tools is used to verify the proposed constraint programming model, and the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and feasible. },

  abstract={ The goal of helping to automate the management of an individual's time is ambitious in terms both of knowledge engineering and of the quality of the plans produced by an AI system. Modeling an individual's activities is itself a challenge, due to the variety of activity, constraint, and preference types involved. Activities might be simple or interruptible; they might have fixed or variable durations, constraints over their temporal domains, and binary constraints between them. Activities might require the individual being at specific locations in order, whereas traveling time should be taken into account. Some activities might require exclusivity, whereas others can be overlapped with compatible concurrent activities. Finally, while scheduled activities generate utility for the individual, extra utility might result from the way activities are scheduled in time, individually and in conjunction. 
           This article presents a rigorous, expressive model to represent an individual's activities, that is, activities whose scheduling is not contingent on any other person. Joint activities such as meetings are outside our remit; it is expected that these are arranged manually or through negotiation mechanisms and they are considered as fixed busy times in the individual's calendar. The model, formulated as a constraint optimization problem, is general enough to accommodate a variety of situations. We present a scheduler that operates on this rich model, based on the general squeaky wheel optimization framework and enhanced with domain-dependent heuristics and forward checking. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates both the efficiency and the effectiveness of the selected approach.

We describe an instance generator for this problem and publicly available instance sets, both randomly generated and real-world data. Finally, we present and evaluate different metaheuristic approaches to solve the scheduling subproblem, where the assembled jobs are already provided.

  abstract={ Abstract  In intelligent manufacturing, it is important to schedule orders from customers efficiently. Make-to-order companies may have to reject or postpone orders when the production capacity does not meet the demand. Many such real-world scheduling problems are characterised by processing times being dependent on the start time (time dependency) or on the preceding orders (sequence dependency), and typically have an earliest and latest possible start time. We introduce and analyze four algorithmic ideas for this class of time/sequence-dependent over-subscribed scheduling problems with time windows: a novel hybridization of adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) and tabu search (TS), a new randomization strategy for neighbourhood operators, a partial sequence dominance heuristic, and a fast insertion strategy. Through factor analysis, we demonstrate the performance of these new algorithmic features on problem domains with varying properties. Evaluation of the resulting general purpose algorithm on three domains—an order acceptance and scheduling problem, a real-world multi-orbit agile Earth observation satellite scheduling problem, and a time-dependent orienteering problem with time windows—shows that our hybrid algorithm robustly outperforms general algorithms including a mixed integer programming method, a constraint programming method, recent state-of-the-art problem-dependent meta-heuristic methods, and a two-stage hybridization of ALNS and TS. },

  abstract={ Abstract  Traffic engineering seeks to route traffic demands in data networks to guarantee certain quality of service (QoS) parameters while efficiently utilizing network resources. MPLS, for example, provides the essential capabilities to achieve this with explicit routing. Finding paths for all the demands which meet QoS requirements is a nontrivial task. Indeed, guaranteeing just bandwidth is known to be 𝒩𝒫‐hard. In this paper, we propose a new complete (exact) algorithm for solving this problem, which is a hybrid that tightly integrates Lagrangian optimization and Constraint Programming search. We evaluate its performance on a set of benchmark tests, based on a large well‐provisioned commercial backbone. The tests involve demand sets of varying size, mostly between 100 and 600 demands. We compare the results with those achieved by several other well‐known algorithms, some complete and some heuristic. This reveals that the hybrid algorithm typically yields the most informative results in the most effective way. It resolves most of the test cases either by finding a solution or by proving infeasibility, each taking only a few seconds. Moreover, the solutions found for solvable problems are provably near‐optimal. The results show, perhaps surprisingly, that the routing task can be difficult even in a very well‐provisioned network. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. },

        A challenging Earth-observing satellite scheduling problem was recently studied in (Frank, Do and Tran 2016) for which the best resolution approach so far on the proposed benchmark is a time-indexed Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation. This MILP formulation produces feasible solutions but is not able to prove optimality or to provide tight optimality gaps, making it difficult to assess the quality of existing solutions. In this paper, we first introduce an alternative disjunctive MILP formulation that manages to close more than half of the instances of the benchmark. This MILP formulation is then relaxed to provide good bounds on optimal values for the unsolved instances. We then propose a CP Optimizer model that consistently outperforms the original time-indexed MILP formulation, reducing the optimality gap by more than 4 times. This Constraint Programming (CP) formulation is very concise: we give its complete OPL implementation in the paper. Some improvements of this CP model are reported resulting in an approach that produces optimal or near-optimal solutions (optimality gap smaller than 1%) for about 80% of the instances. Unlike the MILP formulations, it is able to quickly produce good quality schedules and it is expected to be flexible enough to handle the changing requirements of the application.

 Purpose 
 Resource-constrained assembly lines are widely found in industries that manufacture complex products. In such lines, tasks may require specific resources to be processed. Therefore, decisions on which tasks and resources will be assigned to each station must be made. When the number of available stations is fixed, the problem’s main goal becomes the minimisation of cycle time (type-II version). This paper aims to explore this variant of the problem that lacks investigation in the literature. 
 
 
 Design/methodology/approach 
 In this paper, the authors propose mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models to minimise cycle time in resource-constrained assembly lines, given a limited number of stations and resources. Dedicated and alternative resource types for tasks are considered in different scenarios. 
 
 
 Findings 
 Besides, past modelling decisions and assumptions are questioned. The authors discuss how they were leading to suboptimal solutions and offer a rectification. 
 
 
 Practical implications 
 The proposed models and data set fulfil more practical concerns by taking into account characteristics found in real-world assembly lines. 
 
 
 Originality/value 
 The proposed MILP models are applied to an existing data set, results are compared against a constraint programming model, and new optimal solutions are obtained. Moreover, a data set extension is proposed due to the simplicity of the current one and instances up to 70 tasks are optimally solved.

  abstract={  Management of projects is complicated by the scarcity of resources required to execute them. Limited resources usually extend the project completion times beyond those determined by CPM/PERT. Several solution procedures have been developed for solving the resource constrained project scheduling problem. One objective commonly used for these problems is to complete the project as early as possible (minimize makespan). The problem considered in this paper is a resource constrained project scheduling problem, with the added features that there are cash flows associated with the project activities, and the objective is to schedule the project activities in such a way that the net present value of cash flows is maximized. With these features the problem becomes financially motivated and more realistic.    We introduce a branch and bound procedure to solve the resource constrained project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows. Our procedure exploits the known fact that potential resource violations can be eliminated by introducing additional precedence relations between certain project activities. Specifically, we use the “minimal delaying alternatives” concept to resolve resource conflicts. The bounds in the branch and bound procedure are computed by solving Payment Scheduling Problems, which can be formulated as linear programs and by that are well-solvable.    We test our procedure computationally on a set of 90 test problems from the literature and compare it with the only other exact procedure we know of.  },

  abstract={  Constraint-based scheduling is a powerful tool for solving complex real-life scheduling problems thanks to a natural integration of special solving algorithms encoded in so-called global constraints. Global constraints describe subproblems of the scheduling problem, eg, allocation of activities to a disjunctive resource. Filtering algorithms behind these constraints are used to prune the search space by eliminating options that violate the constraint. The filtering algorithms are frequently expressed in the form of propagation rules that react to some change appearing during problem solving, eg, adding a new precedence relation, by proposing a derived restriction, eg, shrinking a time window. These changes can be invoked by other constraints or they can be a result of some search decision. This paper describes new incremental propagation rules integrating propagation of precedence relations and time windows for activities allocated to a disjunctive resource. Moreover, the rules also cover so-called optional activities that may or may not be present in the final schedule.  },

That is, given operational resource constraints on extraction and processing, we seek a net present value-maximizing schedule of when, if ever, to extract each block in a deposit. We present a version of the problem, which some literature refers to as (CPIT). This constrained ultimate pit limit problem (i.e., open-pit production-scheduling problem variant) produces a sequence of blocks to extract given minimum and maximum bounds on production and processing capacity, and geospatial precedences. Our tutorial demonstrates methods to expedite solutions for instances of this model through variable definition, preprocessing, algorithmic choice, and the provision of an initial feasible solution.

  abstract={ Abstract  This article presents a column generation approach to a resource allocation problem arising in managing Wireless Mesh Networks. The problem consists in routing the given demands over the network and to allocate time resource to pairs of nodes. Half‐duplex constraints are taken into account together with the aggregate interference due to simultaneous transmissions, which affects the signal quality. Different problems are considered, according to the assumptions on the transmission power and rate. The resource allocation problem can be formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem and dealt with a column generation‐based approach. The pricing problem, due to signal quality constraints, turns out to be computationally demanding. To tackle these difficulties, besides a classical mathematical programming approach, we have applied a hybrid column generation approach where the pricing subproblem is solved using Constraint Programming. Numerical results show that the two methods are comparable. The results of the column generation are then used to solve heuristically the problem. The obtained results provide very small gaps (between lower bounds and Heuristic solutions) for two of the three considered problems and reasonable gaps for the third problem. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract={  In this paper a branch-and-bound procedure is described for scheduling the activities of a project of the PERT/CPM variety subject to precedence and resource constraints where the objective is to minimize project duration. The procedure is based on a depth-first solution strategy in which nodes in the solution tree represent resource and precedence feasible partial schedules. Branches emanating from a parent node correspond to exhaustive and minimal combinations of activities, the delay of which resolves resource conflicts at each parent node. Precedence and resource-based bounds described in the paper are combined with new dominance pruning rules to rapidly fathom major portions of the solution tree. The procedure is programmed in the C language for use on both a mainframe and a personal computer. The procedure has been validated using a standard set of test problems with between 7 and 50 activities requiring up to three resource types each. Computational experience on a personal computer indicates that the procedure is 11.6 times faster than the most rapid solution procedure reported in the literature while requiring less computer storage. Moreover, problems requiring large amounts of computer time using existing approaches for solving this problem type are rapidly solved with our procedure using the dominance rules described, resulting in a significant reduction in the variability in solution times as well.  },

  abstract={  Purpose  The purpose of this paper is to propose a new mixed-integer formulation for the time-dependent multi-skilled resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MSRCPSP/t) considering learning effect. The proposed model extends the basic form of the MSRCPSP by three concepts: workforces have different efficiencies, it is possible for workforces to improve their efficiencies by learning from more efficient workers and the availability of workforces and resource requests of activities are time-dependent. To spread dexterity from more efficient workforces to others, this study has integrated the concept of diffusion maximization in social networks into the proposed model. In this respect, the diffusion of dexterity is formulated based on the linear threshold model for a network of workforces who share common skills. The proposed model is bi-objective, aiming to minimize make-span and total costs of project, simultaneously.    Design/methodology/approach  The MSRCPSP is an non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem in the strong sense. Therefore, an improved version of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (IM-NSGA-II) is developed to optimize the make-span and total costs of project, concurrently. For the proposed algorithm, this paper has designed new genetic operators that help to spread dexterity among workforces. To validate the solutions obtained by the IM-NSGA-II, four other evolutionary algorithms – the classical NSGA-II, non-dominated ranked genetic algorithm, Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm II and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm II – are used. All algorithms are calibrated via the Taguchi method.    Findings  Comprehensive numerical tests are conducted to evaluate the performance of the IM-NSGA-II in comparison with the other four methods in terms of convergence, diversity and computational time. The computational results reveal that the IM-NSGA-II outperforms the other methods in terms of most of the metrics. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is implemented to investigate the impact of learning on objective function values. The outputs show the significant impact of learning on objective function values.    Practical implications  The proposed model and algorithm can be used for scheduling activities of small- and large-size real-world projects.    Originality/value  Based on the previous studies reviewed in this paper, one of the research gaps is the MSRCPSP with time-dependent resource capacities and requests. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective model for the MSRCPSP with time-dependent resource profiles. Besides, the evaluation of learning effect on efficiency of workforces has not been studied sufficiently in the literature. In this study, the effect of learning on efficiency of workforces has been considered. In the scarce number of proposed models with learning effect, the researchers have assumed that the efficiency of workforces increases as they spend more time on performing a skill. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the effect of learning from more efficient co-workers has not been studied in the literature of the RCPSP. Therefore, in this research, the effect of learning from more efficient co-workers has been investigated. In addition, a modified version of the NSGA-II algorithm is developed to solve the model.  },

For preemptive job-shop scheduling, two basic search strategies, Depth-First Search and Limited Discrepancy Search, are compared. For Vehicle Routing we report an Incremental Local Optimisation heuristic, combined with Limited Discrepancy Search. Finally, we show how ad hoc algebras can considerably enhance the design of heuristics based on local and global search within a constraint-programming environment.

            In this article, we present a constraint programming approach for solving hard design problems present when automatically designing specialized processor extensions. Specifically, we discuss our approach for automatic selection and synthesis of processor extensions as well as efficient application compilation for these newly generated extensions. The discussed approach is implemented in our integrated design framework,
             IFPEC 
            , built using Constraint Programming (CP). In our framework, custom instructions, implemented as processor extensions, are defined as computational patterns and represented as graphs. This, along with the graph representation of an application, provides a way to use our CP framework equipped with subgraph isomorphism and connected component constraints for identification of processor extensions as well as their selection, application scheduling, binding, and routing. All design steps assume architectures composed of runtime reconfigurable cells, implementing selected extensions, tightly connected to a processor. An advantage of our approach is the possibility of combining different heterogeneous constraints to represent and solve all our design problems. Moreover, the flexibility and expressiveness of the CP framework makes it possible to solve simultaneously extension selection, application scheduling, and binding and improve the quality of the generated results. The article is largely illustrated with experimental results.

Due to its intrinsic complexity, the problem is divided in two distinct subproblems: crew scheduling and crew rostering. We have investigated each of these problems using mathematical programming (MP) and constraint logic programming (CLP) approaches. In addition, we developed hybrid column generation algorithms for solving these problems, combining MP and CLP. The hybrid algorithms always performed better, when obtaining optimal solutions, than the two previous isolated approaches. In particular, they proved to be much faster for the scheduling problem. All the proposed algorithms have been implemented and tested over real-world data obtained from the aforementioned company. The coefficient matrix of the linear program associated with some instances of the scheduling problem contains tens of millions of columns; this number is even larger for the rostering problem. The analysis of our experiments indicates that it was possible to find high-quality, and many times optimal, solutions that were suitable for the company’s needs. These solutions were obtained within reasonable computational times on a desktop PC.  },

The new code fully exploits the advantages of 32-bit programming provided by recent compilers running on platforms such as Windows NT ®  and OS/2 ® : flat memory, increased addressable memory, and fast program execution. We study the impact of three important variables on the computation time for the RCPSP: addressable computer memory, the search strategy (depth-first, best-first, or hybrid), and the introduction of a stronger lower bound. We compare the results obtained by a truncated branch-and-bound procedure with the results generated by the minimum slack time heuristic and report on the dependency of its solution quality on the allotted CPU time.  },

  abstract={ Designing a search heuristic for constraint programming that is reliable across problem domains has been an important research topic in recent years. This paper concentrates on one family of candidates: counting-based search. Such heuristics seek to make branching decisions that preserve most of the solutions by determining what proportion of solutions to each individual constraint agree with that decision. Whereas most generic search heuristics in constraint programming rely on local information at the level of the individual variable, our search heuristics are based on more global information at the constraint level. We design several algorithms that are used to count the number of solutions to specific families of constraints and propose some search heuristics exploiting such information. The experimental part of the paper considers eight problem domains ranging from well-established benchmark puzzles to rostering and sport scheduling. An initial empirical analysis identifies heuristic maxSD as a robust candidate among our proposals.eWe then evaluate the latter against the state of the art, including the latest generic search heuristics, restarts, and discrepancy-based tree traversals. Experimental results show that counting-based search generally outperforms other generic heuristics. },

  abstract={ Abstract  The quay crane scheduling problem consists of determining a sequence of unloading and loading movements for cranes assigned to a vessel in order to minimize the vessel completion time as well as the crane idle times. Idle times originate from interferences between cranes since these roll on the same rails and a minimum safety distance must be maintained between them. The productivity of container terminals is often measured in terms of the time necessary to load and unload vessels by quay cranes, which are the most important and expensive equipment used in ports. We formulate the quay crane scheduling problem as a vehicle routing problem with side constraints, including precedence relationships between vertices. For small size instances our formulation can be solved by CPLEX. For larger ones we have developed a branch‐and‐cut algorithm incorporating several families of valid inequalities, which exploit the precedence constraints between vertices. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract={ Artificial intelligence is considered to be a significant technology for driving the future evolution of smart manufacturing environments. At the same time, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play an essential role in manufacturing systems due to their potential to improve internal logistics by increasing production flexibility. Thereby, the productivity of the entire system relies on the quality of the schedule, which can achieve production cost savings by minimizing delays and the total makespan. However, traditional scheduling algorithms often have difficulties in adapting to changing environment conditions, and the performance of a selected algorithm depends on the individual scheduling problem. Therefore, this paper aimed to analyze the scheduling problem classes of AGVs by applying design science research to develop an algorithm selection approach. The designed artifact addressed a catalogue of characteristics that used several machine learning algorithms to find the optimal solution strategy for the intended scheduling problem. The contribution of this paper is the creation of an algorithm selection method that automatically selects a scheduling algorithm, depending on the problem class and the algorithm space. In this way, production efficiency can be increased by dynamically adapting the AGV schedules. A computational study with benchmark literature instances unveiled the successful implementation of constraint programming solvers for solving JSSP and FJSSP scheduling problems and machine learning algorithms for predicting the most promising solver. The performance of the solvers strongly depended on the given problem class and the problem instance. Consequently, the overall production performance increased by selecting the algorithms per instance. A field experiment in the learning factory at Reutlingen University enabled the validation of the approach within a running production scenario. },

  abstract={ Many of the works conducted on algorithm selection strategies—methods that choose a suitable solving method for a particular problem—start from scratch since only a few investigations on reusable components of such methods are found in the literature. Additionally, researchers might unintentionally omit some implementation details when documenting the algorithm selection strategy. This makes it difficult for others to reproduce the behavior obtained by such an approach. To address these problems, we propose to rely on existing techniques from the Machine Learning realm to speed-up the generation of algorithm selection strategies while improving the modularity and reproducibility of the research. The proposed solution model is implemented on a domain-independent Machine Learning module that executes the core mechanism of the algorithm selection task. The algorithm selection strategies produced in this work are implemented and tested rapidly compared against the time it would take to build a similar approach from scratch. We produce four novel algorithm selectors based on Machine Learning for constraint satisfaction problems to verify our approach. Our data suggest that these algorithms outperform the best performing algorithm on a set of test instances. For example, the algorithm selectors Multiclass Neural Network (MNN) and Multiclass Logistic Regression (MLR), powered by a neural network and linear regression, respectively, reduced the search cost (in terms of consistency checks) of the best performing heuristic (KAPPA), on average, by 49% for the instances considered for this work. },

  abstract={ This study addresses the problem of minimizing tool switching instants in automated manufacturing systems. There exist a single machine and a group of jobs to be processed on it. Each job requires a set of tools, and due to limited tool magazine capacity, and because it is not possible to load all available tools on the machine, tools must be switched. The ultimate goal, in this framework, is to minimize the total number of tool switching instants. We provide a mathematical programming model and two constraint programming models for the problem. Because the problem is proven to be NP-hard, we develop two heuristic approaches, and compare their performance with methods described in the literature. Our analysis indicates that our constraint programming models perform relatively well in solution quality and execution time in small-sized problem instances. The performance of our greedy approach shows potential, reaching the optimal solution in 82.5% of instances. We also statistically demonstrate that the search algorithm enhances the quality of the solution obtained by the greedy heuristic, particularly in large sets. Hence, the solution approach, i.e., the greedy heuristic and the search algorithm proposed in this study is able to quickly reach near-optimal solutions, showing that the method is appropriate for manufacturing settings requiring sudden adjustments. },

The MRCPSP is known to be nondeterministic polynomial‐time hard and has been solved using various exact, heuristic, and meta‐heuristic procedures. In this paper, a modified variable neighborhood search heuristic algorithm is used as an advanced optimization technique that suits scheduling problems. For the experimental study, we have considered a standard set of 3929 multi‐mode benchmark instances from the project scheduling library with a range of projects comprising 10–30 activities. Moreover, for a better comparison, this research also considers a standard set of 4320 newly developed multi‐mode instances from MMLIB50, MMLIB100, and MMLIB+ datasets. With the limit of 50,000 schedules on these datasets, our proposed algorithm provides better makespan for 106, 34, and 1601 instances, respectively, which justifies the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, particularly for projects with a larger number of activities. The results reported in this paper can be used as a benchmark for other researchers to compare and improve. },

In addition, an LOB‐based scheduling optimization model for resource leveling is proposed. This model retains the advantages of the conventional models, including multiple‐resource management and natural rhythm concept, and showcases new abilities: scheduling optimization without specifying a fixed schedule; scheduling optimization on more comprehensive optimization objects and variable values; maintaining continuity of resource while completely eliminating the occurrence of idle time; handling more comprehensive constraints after the addition of logical constraints and explicit expression of certain new constraints. The flexibility, practicality, and solution quality of the proposed model were enhanced accordingly. Further, a scheduling system was developed to assist in schedule optimization and visualization. Lastly, effectiveness of the proposed model was verified based on four case studies involving three case projects investigated in extant LOB‐based studies. },

Design/methodology/approach  This paper addresses the RCPSP in dynamic environments, which assumes resources will be disrupted randomly, that is, the information about resource disruption is not known in advance. To this end, a reactive scheduling model is proposed for the case of random dynamic disruptions of resources. To solve the reactive scheduling model, a hybrid genetic algorithm with a variable neighborhood search is proposed.    Findings  The results obtained on the PSLIB instances prove the performance advantage of the algorithm; through sensitivity analysis, it can be obtained, the project makespan increases exponentially as the number of disruptions increase. Furthermore, if more than 50% of the project's resources are randomly disrupted, the project makespan will be significantly impacted.    Originality/value  The paper focuses on the impact of dynamic resource disruptions on project makespan. Few studies have considered stochastic, dynamic resource uncertainty. In addition, this research proposes a reasonable scheduling algorithm for the research problem, and the conclusions drawn from the research provide decision support for project managers.  },

To improve the time performance of available constraint programming tool and to satisfy a selected objective function, a combination of three classes of heuristics are proposed: bound heuristics, separation heuristics, and search heuristics. Experimental evaluation of the implemented software in Belgrade railway dispatching area indicates that the proposed approach is capable of providing the support to a real‐life operational railway control.

  abstract={ Crew scheduling is one of the crucial processes in railroad operation planning. Based on current regulations and working and break time requirements, as well as the operational rules, this process aims to find a duty arrangement with minimal cost that covers all trips. Most past studies considered this subject for railroad systems as an optimization problem and solved it with mathematical programming-based methods or heuristic algorithms, despite numerous logical constraints embedded in this problem. Few studies have applied constraint programming (CP) approaches to tackle the railroad crew scheduling problem. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to solve the problem with a CP model for duty generation, and an integer programming model for duty optimization. These models have been applied to the Kaohsiung depot of Taiwan Railways Administration, the largest railroad operator in Taiwan. The encouraging results show that the proposed approach is more efficient than the manual process and can achieve 30% savings of driver cost. Moreover, the approach is robust and provides flexibility to easily accommodate related operational concerns such as minimizing the number of overnight duties. Thus, this hybrid two-phase approach seems to have the potential for applications to the railroad crew scheduling problems outside Taiwan. },

In particular, limited discrepancy search and its variations have been shown to achieve significant improvements in efficiency over depth-first search for some classes of applications.This article reconsiders the implementation of discrepancy search, and of search strategies in general, for applications where the search procedure is dynamic, randomized, and/or generates global cuts (or nogoods) that apply to the remaining search. It illustrates that recomputation-based implementations of discrepancy search are not robust with respect to these extensions and require special care which may increase the memory requirements significantly and destroy the genericity of the implementation.To remedy these limitations, the article proposes a novel implementation scheme based on problem decomposition, which combines the efficiency of the recomputation-based implementations with the robustness of traditional iterative implementations. Experimental results on job-shop scheduling problems illustrate the potential of this new implementation scheme, which, surprisingly, may significantly outperform recomputation-based schemes. },

           Our goal is to develop a scheduling framework usable for all spatial architectures. To this end, we expresses spatial scheduling as a constraint satisfaction problem using Integer Linear Programming (ILP). We observe that architecture primitives and scheduler responsibilities can be related through five abstractions: placement of computation, routing of data, managing event timing, managing resource utilization, and forming the optimization objectives. We encode these responsibilities as 20 general ILP constraints, which are used to create schedulers for the disparate TRIPS, DySER, and PLUG architectures. Our results show that a general declarative approach using ILP is implementable, practical, and typically matches or outperforms specialized schedulers. },

The theory of constraints is applied to make plans and schedules for operating rooms based on the capacity constraints of the operating room itself and downstream wards. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed considering shifting bottleneck resources among the operating room, intensive care unit, and hospital wards to maximize the utilization of resources at all levels of planning. Different sizes of planning and scheduling problems of the hospital, including small, medium, and large sizes, are created with variable arrivals and surgery durations and solved using a CPLEX solver for validating the developed models. Later, the application of the proposed models in the real world to develop planning systems for hospitals is discussed, and future extensions are suggested. },

  abstract={ Currently-used decision support solutions allow decision makers to estimate the cost of developing a new product, its production, and promotion, and compare the estimated cost to the target cost. However, these solutions are inadequate for supporting simulations of identifying conditions, by which the specific cost is reached. The proposed approach provides a framework for searching for possible variants towards reaching the target production cost. This paper is concerned with a prototyping problem of product development described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem. The proposed method uses parametric estimation to identify relationships between variables, and constraint programming to search for project completion variants within the company’s resources and project requirements. The results of an experiment indicate that constraint programming provides effective search strategies for finding admissible solutions. Consequently, the proposed approach allows decision makers to obtain alternative scenarios within the limits imposed by the production process. In this, it outperforms current methods dedicated to the support of evaluating the total cost of a new product. The declarative approach presented in this paper is used to model the production cost; however, it can be effortlessly extended to other aspects of product development (e.g., product reliability). },

The algorithm is based on the plane-sweep technique and can handle polygons with complicated constraints. The input to the algorithm consists of the contour of a parameterized polygon to be partitioned and a set of constraints for parameters of the contour. The algorithm uses horizontal cuts only and generates a number of nonoverlapping trapezoids whose union is the original parameterized polygon. Processing of constraints and coordinates that contain first-order multiple-variable polynomials has been made possible by incorporating the JaCoP constraint programming library. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in Java programming language and can be used as the basis to build the trapezoidal corner stitching data structure for parameterized VLSI layout masks. },

The properties of guillotine graphs are examined, and some effective algorithms for dealing with guillotine graphs are proposed. As an application, we then describe a constraint programming method based on guillotine graphs, and we propose effective filtering techniques that use the graph model properties in order to reduce the search space efficiently. Computational experiments are reported on benchmarks from the literature: our algorithm outperforms previous methods when solving the most difficult instances exactly.  },

  abstract={ Abstract  The spatial synthesis problem addressed in this paper is the configuration of rectangles in 2D space, where the sides of the rectangles are parallel to an orthogonal coordinate system. Variables are the locations of the edges of the rectangles and their orientations. Algebraic constraints on these variables define a layout and constitute a constraint satisfaction problem. We give a new  O ( n  2 ) algorithm for incremental path-consistency, which is applied after adding each algebraic constraint. Problem requirements are formulated as spatial relations between the rectangles, for example, adjacency, minimum distance, and nonoverlap. Spatial relations are expressed by Boolean combinations of the algebraic constraints; called disjunctive constraints. Solutions are generated by backtracking search, which selects a disjunctive constraint and instantiates its disjuncts. The selected disjuncts describe an equivalence class of configurations that is a significantly different solution. This method generates the set of significantly different solutions that satisfy all the requirements. The order of instantiating disjunctive constraints is critical for search efficiency. It is determined dynamically at each search state, using functions of heuristic measures called textures. Textures implement fail-first and prune-early strategies. Extensions to the model, that is, 3D configurations, configurations of nonrectangular shapes, constraint relaxation, optimization, and adding new rectangles during search are discussed. },

  abstract={ Quantum annealing has gained considerable attention because it can be applied to combinatorial optimization problems, which have numerous applications in logistics, scheduling, and finance. In recent years, with the technical development of quantum annealers, research on solving practical combinatorial optimization problems using them has accelerated. However, researchers struggle to find practical combinatorial optimization problems, for which quantum annealers outperform mathematical optimization solvers. Moreover, there are only a few studies that compare the performance of quantum annealers with the state-of-the-art solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX. This study determines that quantum annealing demonstrates better performance than the solvers in that the solvers take longer to reach the objective function value of the solution obtained by the quantum annealers for the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament. We also explain the desirable performance of quantum annealing for the sparse interaction between variables and a problem without constraints. In this process, we demonstrate that this problem can be expressed as a 4-regular graph. Through computational experiments, we solve this problem using our quantum annealing approach and two-integer programming approaches, which were performed using the latest quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, and Gurobi, respectively. Further, we compare the quality of the solutions and the computational time. Quantum annealing was able to determine the exact solution in 0.05 seconds for problems with 20 teams, which is a practical size. In the case of 36 teams, it took 84.8 s for the integer programming method to reach the objective function value, which was obtained by the quantum annealer in 0.05 s. These results not only present the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament as an example of applying quantum annealing to practical optimization problems, but also contribute to find problems that can be effectively solved by quantum annealing. },

  abstract={  Many asset management systems generate work plans for different asset components independently. Coordination of projects between different assets, such as pavement and bridge rehabilitations in the same, adjacent, or nearby locations, is often performed only on an ad hoc basis. Poorly coordinated projects might cause unnecessary traffic disruptions and increased agency costs. This paper presents two optimization models to coordinate asset projects systematically with the application of integer programming and constraint programming. The objective of the two models was to maximize the total benefits of the projects, including project benefits and coordination benefits, by rescheduling some projects subject to budget constraints and project timing constraints. The project benefits were assessed on the basis of relationship between the asset condition and the vehicle operating cost. The project coordination benefits were estimated for road users and highway agencies. An example problem was solved to improve an uncoordinated work plan consisting of 26 asset preservation projects. The results show that the two models yield the same solution and the total benefits could be increased significantly by project coordination. The models can be implemented by highway agencies to support their cross-asset management decisions.  },

  abstract={ It may be very difficult to achieve the optimal shift schedule in call centers which have highly uncertain and peaked demand during short time periods. Overlapping shift systems are usually designed for such cases. This paper studies shift scheduling and rostering problems for inbound call centers where overlapping shift systems are used. An integer programming model that determines which shifts to be opened and how many operators to be assigned to these shifts is proposed for the shift scheduling problem. For the rostering problem both integer programming and constraint programming models are developed to determine assignments of operators to all shifts, weekly days-off, and meal and relief break times of the operators. The proposed models are tested on real data supplied by an outsource call center and optimal results are found in an acceptable computation time. An improvement of 15% in the objective function compared to the current situation is observed with the proposed model for the shift scheduling problem. The computational performances of the proposed integer and constraint programming models for the rostering problem are compared using real data observed at a call center and simulated test instances. In addition, benchmark instances are used to compare our Constraint Programming (CP) approach with the existing models. The results of the comprehensive computational study indicate that the constraint programming model runs more efficiently than the integer programming model for the rostering problem. The originality of this research can be attributed to two contributions: (a) a model for shift scheduling problem and two models for rostering problem are presented in detail and compared using real data and (b) the rostering problem is considered as a task-resource allocation and considerably shorter computation times are obtained by modeling this new problem via CP. },

  abstract={ The preservation and maintenance of ancient buildings, particularly heritage buildings, is a complex process that requires careful consideration of several aspects, including maintenance plans and budget availability. An effective long-term maintenance plan is crucial for preserving the historical value and condition of these buildings. The primary purpose of such a plan is to limit building deterioration, maintain optimal building performance, minimize operational costs and ensure budget constraints are met. This study introduces an innovative methodology to optimize maintenance strategies for heritage buildings in various scenarios, including normal conditions and the aftermath of possible catastrophic events. The proposed methodology compares different parameters, such as building conditions, building service life and various types of maintenance interventions. However, budget availability poses a significant challenge in many case studies, and addressing budgetary constraints is notoriously difficult. Limited budgets may hinder the implementation of desired maintenance activities, necessitating optimization of the maintenance plan to overcome these issues. To address these challenges, this study utilizes constraint programming (CP) as an optimization tool. Constraint programming is a powerful optimization methodology that addresses combinatorial problems by formulating them as mathematical models and handling the associated constraints. By representing the problem as one or more instances of the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), constraint programming enables efficient and effective problem solving. The proposed CP model proves to be a valuable tool in solving maintenance scheduling problems for heritage buildings. The results of this study are intended to assist decision makers in developing long-term maintenance plans for heritage building preservation. },

  abstract={  Many AI synthesis problems such as planning, scheduling or design may be encoded in a constraint satisfaction problems (CSP). A CSP is typically defined as the problem of finding any consistent labeling for a fixed set of variables satisfying all given constraints between these variables. However, for many real tasks, the set of constraints to consider may evolve because of the environment or because of user interactions. The notion of dynamic CSP (DCSP) [DD88] has been proposed to represent such evolutions. The problem we consider here is the solution maintenance problem in a DCSP.    Naively applying usual satisfaction algorithms to this problem results in redundant search and inefficiency. A general approach to suppress redundancies in case of both restrictions and relaxations is to concisely represent the frontier of the solution space and justifications of this frontier in terms of set of constraints. This paper proposes a new class of constraint recording algorithms called nogood recording that may be used for solving both dynamic CSPs and usual CSP (called static CSPs here). It offers an interesting compromise, polynomially bounded in space, between an ATMS-like (Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System) approach, that would give a precise and exhaustive description of the frontier, and the usual constraint satisfaction algorithms (that discover a new frontier at each execution). We first introduce the principles used for nogood generation and then examine various recording schemes, on top of different tree search algorithms, characterizing the tradeoffs between the amount of recorded constraints and the pruning achieved. We then present experimental results and comparisons with various existing techniques for solving static or dynamic CSP.  },

  abstract={ Over the last several decades, the scheduling of linear construction projects (LCPs) has been explored extensively by experts. The linear scheduling method (LSM), which focuses on work rate and work continuity, has the advantage of tackling LCPs’ scheduling problems. The traditional LSM uses work continuity to monitor resource allocation continuity on the premise that activities with the same type of work use the same crew. However, some LCPs require a combination of different types of equipment to comprise the crew. Sometimes, parts of different crews require the same types of equipment, and sometimes, the same crew requires different equipment configurations. This causes the pattern of work continuity to be different from the pattern of resource allocation continuity. Therefore, we propose an optimization model of the LSM to minimize idle equipment on a non-sequential linear construction project—i.e., a road network maintenance project. This model is intended to minimize the number of idle equipment and their idle time to achieve more efficient scheduling for linear construction projects. This model offers novel details of resource allocation continuity assessment by taking into account equipment combination and configuration (ECC). Therefore, the scheduling concept used by the proposed model is named the linear scheduling model with ECC (LSM–ECC). The model was developed using constraint programming (CP), as CP has good performance and robustness in the optimization field. The model was implemented to a representation of a road network maintenance project and has satisfactory results. },

Especially, when repetitive activities are involved, traditional resource‐constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) models fail to allocate the resource consumption in an efficient manner. Besides, actual models only provide local optimal solutions and do not incorporate activity acceleration routines. To fulfill this gap, partially, a mathematical optimization model, the multimode RCPSP for repetitive activities in construction projects, is proposed and solved to optimality; it takes into account acceleration routines under real construction scenarios using spreadsheets. The article shows a complete computational experimentation over a real construction project, considering several scenarios of resource availabilities and continuity conditions. The model allows analyzing the resources efficiency indexes comparing them to resource consumptions, continuity of activities, and objective functions that reveal that fragmented activities do not provide better resource efficiency outcomes. },

  abstract={ 
 Purpose 
 Two-stage production systems including a processing shop and an assembly stage are widely used in various manufacturing industries. These two stages are usually studied independently which may not lead to ideal results. This paper aims to deal with a two-stage production system including a job shop and an assembly stage. 
 
 
 Design/methodology/approach 
 Some exact methods are proposed based on branch and bound (B&amp;B) approach to minimize the total completion time of products. As B&amp;B approaches are usually time-consuming, three efficient lower bounds are developed for the problem and variable neighborhood search is used to provide proper upper bound of the solution in each branch. In addition, to create branches and search new nodes, two strategies are applied including the best-first search and the depth-first search (DFS). Another feature of the proposed algorithms is that the search space is reduced by releasing the precedence constraint. In this case, the problem becomes equivalent to a parallel machine scheduling problem, and the redundant branches that do not consider the precedence constraint are removed. Therefore, the number of nodes and computational time are significantly reduced without eliminating the optimal solution. 
 
 
 Findings 
 Some numerical examples are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. Comparison result to mathematical model (mixed-integer linear programming) validates the performance accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methods. In addition, computational results indicate the superiority of the DFS strategy with regard to CPU time. 
 
 
 Originality/value 
 Studies about the scheduling problems for two-stage production systems including job shop followed by an assembly stage traditionally present approximate method and metaheuristic algorithms to solve the problem. This is the first study that introduces exact methods based on (B&amp;B) approach.

  abstract={ This paper addresses the Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem with Transfer Times (MSRCPSP-TT). A new model has been developed that incorporates the presence of transfer times within the multi-skill RCPSP. The proposed model aims to minimize project’s duration and cost, concurrently. The MSRCPSP-TT is an NP-hard problem; therefore, a Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Optimization Algorithm (MOMAOA) is proposed to acquire feasible schedules. In the proposed algorithm, each agent represents a feasible solution that works with other agents in a grouped environment. The agents evolve due to their social, autonomous, and self-learning behaviors. Moreover, the adjustment of environment helps the evolution of agents as well. Since the MSRCPSP-TT is a multi-objective optimization problem, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used in different procedures of the MOMAOA. Another novelty of this paper is the application of TOPSIS in different procedures of the MOMAOA. These procedures are utilized for: (1) detecting the leader agent in each group, (2) detecting the global best leader agent, and (3) the global social behavior of the MOMAOA. The performance of the MOMAOA has been analyzed by solving several benchmark problems. The results of the MOMAOA have been validated through comparisons with three other meta-heuristics. The parameters of algorithms are determined by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The Kruskal–Wallis test is implemented to statistically analyze the efficiency of methods. Computational results reveal that the MOMAOA can beat the other three methods according to several testing metrics. Furthermore, the impact of transfer times on project’s duration and cost has been assessed. The investigations indicate that resource transfer times have significant impact on both objectives of the proposed model. },

This extension considers the energy consumption as an additional resource that leads to different execution modes (and durations) of the activities. Consequently, different schedules can be obtained. The objective is to maximize the efficiency of the project, which takes into account the minimization of both makespan and energy consumption. This is a well-known NP-hard problem, such that the application of metaheuristic techniques is necessary to address real-size problems in a reasonable time. This paper shows that the Activity List representation, commonly used in metaheuristics, can lead to obtaining many redundant solutions, that is, solutions that have different representations but are in fact the same. This is a serious disadvantage for a search procedure. We propose a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the MRCPSP-ENERGY, trying to avoid redundant solutions by focusing the search on the execution modes, by using the Mode List representation. The proposed GA is evaluated on different instances of the PSPLIB-ENERGY library and compared to the results obtained by both exact methods and approximate methods reported in the literature. This library is an extension of the well-known PSPLIB library, which contains MRCPSP-ENERGY test cases. },

The MRCPSP is a well‐known project scheduling NP‐Hard optimization problem, in which there is a trade‐off between the duration of each project activity and the amount of resources they require to be completed. The proposed algorithm generates an initial solution, performs a local search to obtain a local optimum, subsequently, for a certain number of iterations, makes a perturbation to that local optimum and performs a new local search on the perturbed solution. This whole process then restarts with a different initial solution for a certain number of restarts. The algorithm was tested on benchmark instances of projects with 30, 50 and 100 activities from well‐known libraries. The obtained results were compared to recent benchmark results from the literature. The proposed algorithm outperforms other solution methods found in related literature for the largest tested instances (100 activities), while for smaller instances it shows to be quite competitive, in terms of the average deviation against known lower bounds. },

In this study, the project scheduling problem and the resource supply problem are regarded as a dynamic game system, with interactive influences and constraints. This study proposes a Stackelberg dynamic game model based on the engineering supply chain perspective. In this model, the inherent conflicts and complex interactions between the Multi-mode Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MRCPSP) and the Multi-Period Supply Chain Problem (MPSCP) are studied to determine the optimal equilibrium strategy. A two-level multi-objective programming method is used to solve the problem. The MRCPSP is the upper-level planning used to optimize project scheduling and activity mode selection to minimize project cost and duration; MPSCP is a lower-level planning method that seeks to make resource transportation decisions at a lower cost. A two-layer hybrid algorithm, consisting of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is proposed to determine the optimal equilibrium strategy. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed optimization method are evaluated through a case study of a large hydropower construction project, and management suggestions for related departments are provided. },

Recognizing the problem as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine learning community has developed the field of meta-learning, focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems. But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss the generalization of meta-learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction, and optimization, and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics, cryptography, and other fields. },

  abstract={ As the largest energy consumption country, China now pays more and more attention to photovoltaic power generation because solar energy is the largest renewable and sustainable energy reserve in the world. In this case, the photovoltaic power generation plant project plays a crucial role in sustainable development, especially in the underdeveloped northwest region of China. This paper focuses on applying bi-level programing to the multimode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) in photovoltaic power generation plant construction, which simultaneously considers the practical hierarchical organization structure and an uncertain decision-making environment. A bi-level fuzzy random multiple objective model is developed, wherein the government agency is in the upper decision level, while the contractor is in the lower decision level. Then, motivated by the particular mathematical nature of the proposed bi-level MRCPSP model, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed. Finally, a practical case from the Shenneng Futa Kashi-Tashi-Kuergan photovoltaic power generation plant project in a Chinese energy company is applied, and the results validate the practicability of the proposed model and solution algorithm for solving practical photovoltaic power plant project scheduling problems. },

The research addresses two key aspects: firstly, the integration of GA RCPSP (Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem) with techniques for managing uncertainty in shipbuilding production; and secondly, the analysis of Pareto optimal solutions generated by GA to achieve optimal scheduling in the shipbuilding context. The proposed framework aims to minimize project completion time and maximize resource utilization by incorporating probabilistic models, scenario analysis to handle uncertainties. Furthermore, the study focuses on evaluating the trade-offs between project completion time, resource allocation, and cost through the analysis of Pareto optimal solutions, using visualization techniques and sensitivity analyses to support decision-making processes. The findings contribute to enhancing shipbuilding production by providing a comprehensive approach for effectively managing uncertainty, improving resource allocation, and reducing project duration through the integration of GA RCPSP and uncertainty management techniques. },

  abstract={ Shift scheduling problems (SSPs) are advanced NP-hard problems which are generally evaluated with integer programming. This study presents an applicable shift schedule of workers in a large-scale natural gas combined cycle power plant (NGCCPP), which realize 35.17% of the total electricity generation in Turkey alone, as at of the end of 2018. This study included 80 workers who worked three shifts in the selected NGCCPP for 30 days. The proposed scheduling model was solved according to the skills of the workers, and there were nine criteria by which the workers were evaluated for their abilities. Analytic network process (ANP) is a method used for obtaining the weights of workers’ abilities in a particular skill. These weights are used in the proposed scheduling model as concepts in goal programming (GP). The SSP–ANP–GP model sees employees’ everyday preferences as their main feature, bringing high-performance to the highest level, and bringing an objective functionality, and lowering the lowest success of daily choice. At the same time, the model introduced large-scale and soft constraints that reflect the nature of the shift requirements of this program by specifying the most appropriate program. The required data were obtained from the selected NGCCPP and the model solutions were approved by the plant experts. The SSP–ANP–GP model was resolved at a reasonable time. Monthly acquisition time was significantly reduced, and the satisfaction of the employees was significantly increased by using the obtained program. When past studies were examined, it was determined that a shift scheduling problem of this size in the energy sector had not previously been studied. },

  abstract={ A lot of projects in real life are subject to some kinds of nonrenewable resources that are not exactly similar to the type defined in the project scheduling literature. The difference stems from the fact that, in those projects, contrary to the common assumption in the project scheduling literature, nonrenewable resources are not available in full amount at the beginning of the project, but they are procured along the project horizon. In this paper, we study this different type of nonrenewable resources. To that end, we extend the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) by this resource type (RCPSP-NR) and customize four basic branch and bound algorithms of RCPSP for it, including precedence tree, extension alternatives, minimal delaying alternatives, and minimal forbidden sets. Several bounding and fathoming rules are introduced to the algorithms to shorten the enumeration process. We perform comprehensive experimental analysis using the four customized algorithms and also CPLEX solver. },

Scheduling them proves a task more demanding than in the case of projects in other industries. Typical objectives of optimization, a characteristic set of constraints, as well as the schedule’s susceptibility to the propagation of disruptions caused by materializing risks, call for specific scheduling methods. The authors review the literature to summarize the existing repetitive scheduling methods and put forward their classification to identify the method’s aspects needing refinement. This is done to point to directions of further research. The authors hope that this study will contribute to better identification of existing problems in planning repetitive construction projects and faster development of decision support systems, eagerly anticipated by the construction practitioners. Though the focus is on applications to construction projects, the repetitive scheduling methods that account for volatile operating conditions may be of interest to researchers who develop planning techniques for other industries. },

  abstract={ Abstract  In this paper, we consider the resource-constrained project scheduling problem with partially renewable resources and general temporal constraints. For the first time, the concept of partially renewable resources is embedded in the context of projects with general temporal constraints. While partially renewable resources have already broadened the area of applications for project scheduling, the extension by general temporal constraints allows to consider even more relevant aspects of real projects. We present a branch-and-bound procedure for the problem with the objective to minimize the project duration. To improve the performance of the solution procedure, new consistency tests, lower bounds, and dominance rules are developed. Furthermore, new temporal planning procedures, based on forbidden start times of activities, are presented which can be used for any project scheduling problem with general temporal constraints independent on the considered resource type. In a performance analysis, we compare our branch-and-bound procedure with the mixed-integer linear programming solver IBM CPLEX 12.8.0 on adaptations of benchmark instances from the literature. In addition, we compare our solution procedure with the only available branch-and-bound procedure for partially renewable resources. The results of the computational experiments prove the efficiency of our branch-and-bound procedure. },

  abstract={  We present a model for activity networks under generalized precedence relations (GPRs), discuss its temporal analysis and the issues that may arise relative to inconsistency among the specified relations and the activity durations. We also give more precise definition to the concept of criticality of an activity, and introduce the new concept of flexibility of an activity which is akin to the traditional concept of activity floats in regular CPM, with the latter taking on different meaning from its common interpretation in standard CPM.    Issues of optimization are raised when one assumes, for each activity, a piecewise-linear time-cost function that permits positive and negative deviations from its least-cost duration between specified lower and upper bounds on that duration. We seek the optimal activity durations subject to the specified GPRs and a given due date λ. We also seek the construction of the complete project duration-cost function between the project minimum duration and its least-cost duration when the due date λ is interpreted, first, as a “deadline” and, second, as a “target date” with rewards for early, and penalties for late completion. The relations between the problems posed and the uncapacitated minimum cost flow problems are revealed and are utilized in the algorithmic solution of the problems.  },

Although heuristics involved in solving these problems have largely been studied in the past, little is known about the relation between instances and the respective performance of the heuristics used to solve them. This paper focuses on both the exploration of the instance space to identify relations between instances and good performing heuristics and how to use such relations to improve the search. Firstly, the document describes a methodology to explore the instance space of constraint satisfaction problems and evaluate the corresponding performance of six variable ordering heuristics for such instances in order to find regions on the instance space where some heuristics outperform the others. Analyzing such regions favors the understanding of how these heuristics work and contribute to their improvement. Secondly, we use the information gathered from the first stage to predict the most suitable heuristic to use according to the features of the instance currently being solved. This approach proved to be competitive when compared against the heuristics applied in isolation on both randomly generated and structured instances of constraint satisfaction problems. },

  abstract={ Balancing Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) and register pressure during preallocation instruction scheduling is a fundamentally important problem in code generation and optimization. The problem is known to be NP-complete. Many heuristic techniques have been proposed to solve this problem. However, due to the inherently conflicting requirements of maximizing ILP and minimizing register pressure, heuristic techniques may produce poor schedules in many cases. If such cases occur in hot code, significant performance degradation may result. A few combinatorial optimization approaches have also been proposed, but none of them has been shown to solve large real-world instances within reasonable time. This article presents the first combinatorial algorithm that is efficient enough to optimally solve large instances of this problem (basic blocks with hundreds of instructions) within a few seconds per instance. The proposed algorithm uses branch-and-bound enumeration with a number of powerful pruning techniques to efficiently search the solution space. The search is based on a cost function that incorporates schedule length and register pressure. An implementation of the proposed scheduling algorithm has been integrated into the LLVM Compiler and evaluated using SPEC CPU 2006. On x86-64, with a time limit of 10ms per instruction, it optimally schedules 79% of the hot basic blocks in FP2006. Another 19% of the blocks are not optimally scheduled but are improved in cost relative to LLVM's heuristic. This improves the execution time of some benchmarks by up to 21%, with a geometric-mean improvement of 2.4% across the entire benchmark suite. With the use of precise latency information, the geometric-mean improvement is increased to 2.8%. },

This paper shows how to parallelize constraint programs transparently without changes to the sequential code. The main technical idea consists of automatically lifting a sequential exploration strategy into its parallel counterpart, allowing workers to share and steal subproblems. Experimental results show that the parallel implementation may produce significant speedups on multicore machines.  },

Previous solution approaches for TLSP have focused primarily on the scheduling subproblem (TLSP-S), for which it is assumed that a suitable grouping is already given as part of the input. In this paper, we provide for the first time a solution approach that encompasses the full problem including grouping. We propose both a Constraint Programming model for TLSP and a Very Large Neighborhood Search algorithm based on that model. Furthermore, we apply our algorithms to real-world instances as well as randomly generated ones and compare our results to the best existing solutions. Experimental results show that our solution methods consistently outperform those for TLSP-S when both are initialised with a good grouping and in many cases even when this grouping is provided only to the latter. },

  abstract={ Currently used decision support systems allow decision-makers to evaluate the product performance, including a net present value analysis, in order to enable them to make a decision regarding whether or not to carry out a new product development project. However, these solutions are inadequate to provide simulations for verifying a possibility of reducing the total product cost through changes in the product design phase. The proposed approach provides a framework for identifying possible variants of changes in product design that can reduce the cost related to the production and after-sales phase. This paper is concerned with using business analytics to cost estimation and simulation regarding changes in product design. The cost of a new product is estimated using analogical and parametric models that base on artificial neural networks. Relationships identified by computational intelligence are used to prepare cost estimation and simulations. A model of product development, production process, and admissible resources is described in terms of a constraint satisfaction problem that is effectively solved using constraint programming techniques. The proposed method enables the selection of a more appropriate technique to cost estimation, the identification of a set of possible changes in product design towards reducing the total product cost, and it is the framework for developing a decision support system. In this aspect, it outperforms current methods dedicated for evaluating the potential of a new product. },

  abstract={ 
            A widely adopted approach to solving constraint satisfaction problems combines systematic tree search with various degrees of constraint propagation for pruning the search space. One common technique to improve the execution efficiency is to add redundant constraints, which are constraints logically implied by others in the problem model. However, some redundant constraints are
             propagation redundant 
            and hence do not contribute additional propagation information to the constraint solver. Redundant constraints arise naturally in the process of redundant modeling where two models of the same problem are connected and combined through channeling constraints. In this paper, we give general theorems for proving propagation redundancy of one constraint with respect to channeling constraints and constraints in the other model. We illustrate, on problems from CSPlib (http://www.csplib.org), how detecting and removing propagation redundant constraints in redundant modeling can speed up search by several order of magnitudes.

Despite their frequent use, one of the drawbacks that they display is that the state the manufacturing system is in dictates the level of performance of the rule. As no rule is better than all the other rules for all system states, it would be highly desirable to know which rule is the most appropriate for each given condition, and to this end this paper proposes a scheduling approach that employs inductive learning and backpropagation neural networks. Using these latter techniques, and by analysing the earlier performance of the system, “scheduling knowledge” is obtained whereby the right dispatching rule at each particular moment can be determined. A module that generates new control attributes is also designed in order to improve the “scheduling knowledge” that is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed approach leads to significant performance improvements over existing dispatching rules. },

        Energy costs are an increasingly important issue in real-world scheduling, for both economic and environmental reasons. This paper deals with a variant of the well-known job shop scheduling problem, where we consider a bi-objective optimization of both the weighted tardiness and the energy costs. To this end, we design a hybrid metaheuristic that combines a genetic algorithm with a novel local search method and a linear programming approach. We also propose an efficient procedure for improving the energy cost of a given schedule. In the experimental study we analyse our proposal and compare it with the state of the art and also with a constraint programming approach, obtaining competitive results.

  abstract={ The article presents a solution approach for the Torpedo Scheduling Problem, an operational planning problem found in steel production. The problem consists of the integrated scheduling and routing of torpedo cars, i. e. steel transporting vehicles, from a blast furnace to steel converters. In the continuous metallurgic transformation of iron into steel, the discrete transportation step of molten iron must be planned with considerable care in order to ensure a continuous material flow. 
The problem is solved by a Simulated Annealing algorithm, coupled with an approach of reducing the set of feasible material assignments. The latter is based on logical reductions and lower bound calculations on the number of torpedo cars. 
Experimental investigations are performed on a larger number of problem instances, which stem from the 2016 implementation challenge of the Association of Constraint Programming (ACP). Our approach was ranked first (joint first place) in the 2016 ACP challenge and found optimal solutions for all used instances in this challenge. },

This combination helps make CLP programs both expressive and flexible, and in some cases, more efficient than other kinds of programs. Though a relatively new field, CLP has progressed in several and quite different directions. In particular, the early fundamental concepts have been adapted to better serve in different areas of applications. In this survey of CLP, a primary goal is to give a systematic description of the major trends in terms of common fundamental concepts. Consider first an example program in order to identify some crucial CLP concepts.

  abstract={ Constraint programming effectively solves constraint satisfaction and optimization problems by basically building, pruning, and exploring a search tree of potential solutions. In this context, a main component is the enumeration strategy, which is responsible for selecting the order in which variables and values are selected to build a possible solution. This process is known to be quite important; indeed a correct selection can reach a solution without failed explorations. However, it is well known that selecting the right strategy is quite challenging as their performance is notably hard to predict. During the last years, adaptive enumeration appeared as a proper solution to this problem. Adaptive enumeration allows the solving algorithm being able to autonomously modifying its strategies in solving time depending on performance information. In this way, the most suitable order for variables and values is employed along the search. In this paper, we present a new and more lightweight approach for performing adaptive enumeration. We incorporate a powerful classification technique named Top-<mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>in order to adaptively select strategies along the resolution. We report results on a set of well-known benchmarks where the proposed approach noticeably competes with classical and modern adaptive enumeration methods for constraint satisfaction. },

With this decomposition, the methodology provides a quick initial feasible solution which is rapidly improved by metaheuristics’ iterative process. Constraint Programming and Lagrangean Relaxation are also embedded within this structure to ensure constraints satisfaction and to reduce the calculation burden. By means of the proposed methodology, promising results have been obtained.

It draws from the experience gained in the early to mid 1990's on flaw selection strategies for POCL planning, and combines this with more recent developments in the field of domain independent planning such as distance based heuristics and reachability analysis.  We present an adaptation of the additive heuristic for plan space planning, and modify it to account for possible reuse of existing actions in a plan.  We also propose a large set of novel flaw selection strategies, and show how these can help us solve more problems than previously possible by POCL planners.  VHPOP also supports planning with durative actions by incorporating standard techniques for temporal constraint reasoning.  We demonstrate that the same heuristic techniques used to boost the performance of classical POCL planning can be effective in domains with durative actions as well.  The result is a versatile heuristic POCL planner competitive with established CSP-based and heuristic state space planners. },

refinement of  really full look ahead  that takes advantage of the problem structure in order 
to enhance the look ahead procedure. We give a formal proof that nRF+ is superior to the 
other approaches in terms of number of visited nodes. An additional contribution of this 
paper is the introduction of a new benchmark for testing algorithms in this domain. It is 
formed by a large set of well-defined graphs of very diverse nature. In this benchmark, we 
show that nRF+ can efficiently solve a broad range of problems, while still leaving many 
problem instances unsolved. The use of this challenging benchmark is encouraged for future 
algorithms evaluation. },

  abstract={ When solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), it is a common practice to rely on heuristics to decide which variable should be instantiated at each stage of the search. But, this ordering influences the search cost. Even so, and to the best of our knowledge, no earlier work has dealt with how first variable orderings affect the overall cost. In this paper, we explore the cost of finding high-quality orderings of variables within constraint satisfaction problems. We also study differences among the orderings produced by some commonly used heuristics and the way bad first decisions affect the search cost. One of the most important findings of this work confirms the paramount importance of first decisions. Another one is the evidence that many of the existing variable ordering heuristics fail to appropriately select the first variable to instantiate. Another one is the evidence that many of the existing variable ordering heuristics fail to appropriately select the first variable to instantiate. We propose a simple method to improve early decisions of heuristics. By using it, performance of heuristics increases. },

  abstract={ When heavy rain strikes Taiwan, it always results in cracks in road pavement, and damages arising from potholes. Tremendously compromising road safety, road users may have fatal accidents caused by untimely repair actions. The road maintenance department needs to take the responsibilities for road sections in the form of inspections and faces the decision about how to properly allocate available resources to repair pavement damages immediately. When performing pavement repair works, we need to consider the resource consumption behavior and explore the mechanism of replenishing resources and calculating the return time. Therefore, in order to help maintenance units to deal with consumable resource issues, this study proposes a novel approach to offer the mechanism of consumable resource calculation, which is difficult to solve through the traditional vehicle routing problem (VRP) approach. This proposed model treats the pothole repair problem as a resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), which is capable of resolving such consumable resource considerations. The proposed model was developed by adopting constraint programming (CP) techniques. Research results showed that the proposed model is capable of providing the optimal decisions of pavement pothole repair tasks and also meets practical requirements to make appropriate adjustment, and helps the maintenance unit to shorten total repair duration and optimize resource assignment decisions of pavement maintenance objectives. },

				  A comprehensive case study of manufacturing scheduling solutions development is given. It includes highly generalized scheduling problem as well as a few scheduling modes, methods and problem models. The considered problem combines flexible job shop structure, lot streaming with variable sublots, transport times, setup times, and machine calendars. Tabu search metaheuristic and constraint programming methods have been used for the off-line scheduling. Two dynamic scheduling methods have also been implemented, i.e., dispatching rules for the completely reactive scheduling and a multi-agent system for the predictivereactive scheduling. In these implementations three distinct models of the problem have been used, based on: graph representation, optimal constraint satisfaction, and Petri net formalism. Each of these solutions has been verified in computational experiments. The results are compared and some findings about advantages, disadvantages, and suggestions on using the solutions are formulated. },

  abstract={ We study here a natural situation when constraint programming can be entirely reduced to 
rule-based programming. To this end we explain first how one can compute on constraint 
satisfaction problems using rules represented by simple first-order formulas. Then we consider 
constraint satisfaction problems that are based on predefined, explicitly given constraints. 
To solve them we first derive rules from these explicitly given constraints and limit the 
computation process to a repeated application of these rules, combined with labeling. We 
consider two types of rule here. The first type, that we call equality rules, leads to a new 
notion of local consistency, called  rule consistency  that turns out to be weaker than arc 
consistency for constraints of arbitrary arity (called hyper-arc consistency in Marriott &amp; 
Stuckey (1998)). For Boolean constraints rule consistency coincides with the closure under the 
well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints. The second type of rules, that we call 
membership rules, yields a rule-based characterization of arc consistency. To show feasibility 
of this rule-based approach to constraint programming, we show how both types of rules can 
be automatically generated, as CHR rules of Frühwirth (1995). This yields an implementation 
of this approach to programming by means of constraint logic programming. We illustrate 
the usefulness of this approach to constraint programming by discussing various examples, 
including Boolean constraints, two typical examples of many valued logics, constraints dealing 
with Waltz's language for describing polyhedral scenes, and Allen's qualitative approach to 
temporal logic. },

The results from ILS were compared to those obtained in a previous work from the same authors that used the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). Initially, both metaheuristics were implemented using, as local search, the classical First Improvement Method, performing "guided" reallocation and exchange of crew tasks. The guided reallocation/exchange replaces random components from the classical method by searching the best position to insert the task. Further, the Very Large-scale Neighborhood Search (VLNS) technique was used as a local search procedure in the metaheuristics. This technique has substantially more neighbors than the 2-opt neighborhoods, since it performs a chain exchange of tasks from different crews. Both versions of metaheuristics were applied to a set of real data from a company operating in the city of Belo Horizonte, producing more economical schedules than those adopted by the company. The results are presented and discussed in this work. },

  abstract={ The success of Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) in many domains created a rich body of research concerned with hardware accelerators for compute-intensive DNN operators. However, implementing such operators efficiently with complex hardware intrinsics such as matrix multiply is a task not yet automated gracefully. Solving this task often requires joint program and data layout transformations. First solutions to this problem have been proposed, such as TVM, UNIT, or ISAMIR, which work on a loop-level representation of operators and specify data layout and possible program transformations before the embedding into the operator is performed. This top-down approach creates a tension between exploration range and search space complexity, especially when also exploring data layout transformations such as im2col, channel packing, or padding. 
           In this work, we propose a new approach to this problem. We created a bottom-up method that allows the joint transformation of both computation and data layout based on the found embedding. By formulating the embedding as a constraint satisfaction problem over the scalar dataflow, every possible embedding solution is contained in the search space. Adding additional constraints and optimization targets to the solver generates the subset of preferable solutions. 
           An evaluation using the VTA hardware accelerator with the Baidu DeepBench inference benchmark shows that our approach can automatically generate code competitive to reference implementations. Further, we show that dynamically determining the data layout based on intrinsic and workload is beneficial for hardware utilization and performance. In cases where the reference implementation has low hardware utilization due to its fixed deployment strategy, we achieve a geomean speedup of up to × 2.813, while individual operators can improve as much as × 170. },

These requests might be heterogeneous (stereoscopic observations, periodic observations, systematic observations, etc.), and one difficulty is that the search space defined by the possible ways of performing the requests given the multiple satellites and ground stations available is huge. This paper studies several combinatorial optimization techniques for solving such an operational problem, including a constraint programming approach and parallel scheduling techniques that take advantage of the problem structure. These algorithms are evaluated on realistic instances involving various request types and objective functions depending on the cloud cover conditions, that highly impact the quality of the images collected. },

  abstract={ Abstract  Solvers for constraint optimisation problems exploit variable and value ordering heuristics. Numerous expert-designed heuristics exist, while recent research learns novel, customised heuristics from past problem instances. This article addresses unseen problems for which no historical data is available. We propose one-shot learning of customised, problem instance-specific heuristics. To do so, we introduce the concept of  deep heuristics , a data-driven approach to learn extended versions of a given variable ordering heuristic online. First, for a problem instance, an initial online probing phase collects data, from which a deep heuristic function is learned. The learned heuristics can look ahead arbitrarily-many levels in the search tree instead of a ‘shallow’ localised lookahead of classical heuristics. A restart-based search strategy allows for multiple learned models to be acquired and exploited in the solver’s optimisation. We demonstrate deep variable ordering heuristics based on the smallest, anti first-fail, and maximum regret heuristics. Results on instances from the MiniZinc benchmark suite show that deep heuristics solve 20% more problem instances while improving on overall runtime for the Open Stacks and Evilshop benchmark problems. },

  abstract={ Environmental issues and sustainability performance are more and more significant in today’s business world. A growing number of manufacturing companies are searching for changes to improve their sustainability in the areas of products and manufacturing processes. These changes should be introduced in the design process and affect the whole product life cycle. This paper is concerned with developing a method based on predictive and prescriptive analytics to identify opportunities for increasing sustainable manufacturing through changes incorporated at the product design stage. Predictive analytics uses parametric models obtained from regression analysis and artificial neural networks in order to predict sustainability performance. In turn, prescriptive analytics refers to the identification of opportunities for improving sustainability performance in manufacturing, and it is based on a constraint programming implemented within a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). The specification of sustainability performance in terms of a CSP provides a pertinent framework for identifying all admissible solutions (if there are any) of the considered problem. The identified opportunities for improving sustainability performance are dedicated to specialists in product development, and aim to reduce both resources used in manufacturing and negative effects on the environment. The applicability of the proposed method is illustrated through reducing the number of defective products in manufacturing. },

  abstract={  The many-to-many stable matching problem (MM), defined in the context of a job market, asks for an assignment of workers to firms satisfying the quota of each agent and being stable, pairwise or setwise, with respect to given preference lists or relations. In this paper, we propose a time-optimal algorithm that identifies all stable worker–firm pairs and all stable assignments under pairwise stability, individual preferences, and the max-min criterion. We revisit the poset graph of rotations to obtain an optimal algorithm for enumerating all solutions to the MM and an improved algorithm finding the minimum-weight one. Furthermore, we establish the applicability of all aforementioned algorithms under more complex preference and stability criteria. In a constraint programming context, we introduce a constraint that models the MM and an encoding of the MM as a constraint satisfaction problem. Finally, we provide a series of computational results, including the case where side constraints are imposed.  },

Our study starts by examining lexicographical variable and value ordering and evaluates different combinations of dynamic variable and value ordering heuristics. We eventually build up to a dynamic variable ordering heuristic that has two rounds of tie-breakers, where the second tie-breaker is a dynamic value ordering heuristic. We show that our method that uses this interlinked heuristic outperforms the previously studied ones with the same experimental setup. Overall, we conclude that constructing insightful dynamic variable ordering heuristics that also utilize a dynamic value ordering heuristic in their decision making process could drastically improve the search effort for some constraint satisfaction problems. },

  abstract={  This paper develops the idea that variable ordering heuristics for CSPs can be characterised in terms of a small number of distinguishable actions or strategies, and that while specific heuristics may be classified differently depending on the problem type, the basic actions that determine their classification are the same. These strategies can be described as building up contention and propagating effects to future, uninstantiated variables. The propagation-of-effects type of action is related to the "simplification hypothesis" of Hooker and Vinay, but since this is only one of two independent actions, this work gives a more complete account of the basis of heuristic performance.    The basic technique uses factor analysis to simplify the set of correlations between performance scores for a particular set of problems. The present work shows that the results of this analysis are robust, and that amenability of a problem to one or the other kind of heuristic action is also a robust effect. This approach also elucidates the effectiveness of modern adaptive heuristics by showing that they balance the two kinds of heuristic action, which is known to enhance performance. The two heuristic actions are distinguished by descriptive measures such as depth of failure and depth at which a problem becomes tractable, that reflect differences in rapidity of effects with respect to search depth. Other experiments indicate that the effectiveness of propagation-of-effects depends on the degree to which nonadjacent assignments can interact in the future part of the problem. Extensions to structured problems suggest that the theoretical analysis can be generalised, although the factor analysis of performance becomes more complicated due to the interaction of the basic actions with specific parts of the problem. This work contributes to the goals of explaining heuristic performance and putting heuristic selection on a rational basis.  },

        There is a strong demand for robots to work in environments, such as aircraft manufacturing, where they share tasks with humans and must quickly adapt to each other's needs. To do so, a robot must both infer the intent of humans, and must adapt accordingly. The literature to date has made great progress on these two tasks - recognition and adaptation - but largely as separate research activities. In this paper, we present a unified approach to these two problems, in which recognition and adaptation occur concurrently and holistically.  Key to our approach is a task representation that uses choice to represent alternative plans for both the human and robot, allowing a single set of algorithms to simultaneously achieve recognition and adaptation. To achieve such fluidity, a labeled propagation mechanism is used where decisions made by the human and robot during execution are propagated to relevant future open choices, as determined by causal link analysis, narrowing the possible options that the human would reasonably take (hence achieving intent recognition) as well as the possible actions the robot could consistently take (adaptation). This paper introduces Pike, an executive for human-robot teamwork that quickly adapts and infers intent based on the preconditions of actions in the plan, temporal constraints, unanticipated disturbances, and choices made previously (by either robot or human).  We evaluate Pike's performance and demonstrate it on a household task in a human-robot team testbed.

  abstract={ Many optimisation problems involve combinatorial constraints on continuous variables. An example of a combinatorial constraint is that at most one variable in a group of nonnegative variables may be positive. Traditionally, in the mathematical programming community, such problems have been modeled as mixed-integer programs by 
introducing auxiliary binary variables and additional constraints. Because the number of variables and constraints becomes larger and the combinatorial structure is not used to advantage, these mixed-integer programming models may not be solved satisfactorily, except for small instances. Traditionally, constraint programming approaches to such problems keep and use the combinatorial structure, but do not use linear programming bounds in the search for an optimal solution. Here we present a branch-and-cut approach that considers the combinatorial constraints without the introduction of binary variables. We review the development of this approach and show how strong constraints can be derived using ideas from polyhedral combinatorics. To illustrate the ideas, we present a production scheduling model that arises in the manufacture of fibre optic cables. },

Instead of only computing with the known part of the constraint, we propose to complete its definition by using Machine Learning techniques. Since constraints are actively used during solving for pruning domains, building a classifier for instances is not enough: we need a solver able to reduce variable domains. Our technique is composed of two steps: first we learn a classifier for each constraint projections and then we transform the classifiers into a propagator. The first contribution is a generic meta-technique for classifier improvement showing performances comparable to boosting. The second lies in the ability of using the learned concept in constraint-based decision or optimization problems. We presents results using Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks for constraint learning and propagation. It opens a new way of integrating Machine Learning in Decision Support Systems.  },

  abstract={ Algorithm selection (AS) techniques -- which involve choosing from a set of algorithms the one expected to solve a given problem instance most efficiently -- have substantially improved the state of the art in solving many prominent AI problems, such as SAT, CSP, ASP, MAXSAT and QBF. Although several AS procedures have been introduced, not too surprisingly, none of them dominates all others across all AS scenarios. Furthermore, these procedures have parameters whose optimal values vary across AS scenarios. This holds specifically for the machine learning techniques that form the core of current AS procedures, and for their hyperparameters. Therefore, to successfully apply AS to new problems, algorithms and benchmark sets, two questions need to be answered: (i) how to select an AS approach and (ii) how to set its parameters effectively. We address both of these problems simultaneously by using automated algorithm configuration. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can automatically configure claspfolio 2, which implements a large variety of different AS approaches and their respective parameters in a single, highly-parameterized algorithm framework. Our approach, dubbed AutoFolio, allows researchers and practitioners across a broad range of applications to exploit the combined power of many different AS methods. We demonstrate AutoFolio can significantly improve the performance of claspfolio 2 on 8 out of the 13 scenarios from the Algorithm Selection Library, leads to new state-of-the-art algorithm selectors for 7 of these scenarios, and matches state-of-the-art performance (statistically) on all other scenarios. Compared to the best single algorithm for each AS scenario, AutoFolio achieves average speedup factors between 1.3 and 15.4. },

  abstract={  Fault propagation analysis is an important step in determining system reliability and defining fault tolerance strategies. Typically, in the early software design phases, the propagation probability for a fault is assumed to be one. However, the assumption that faults will always propagate highly underestimates reliability, and valuable resources may be wasted on fixing faults that may never propagate. To determine the fault propagation probability, a concept of flat parts is introduced. A flat part is a property of a function; when multiple functions containing flat parts interact with each other, these flat parts undergo a transformation. During this transformation, the flat parts may be killed, preserved, or new flat parts may be generated. Interval arithmetic-based rules to determine such flat part transformations are introduced. A flat part-based propagation analysis can be used to determine the reliability of a software system, or software-driven mechanical system expressed functionally. In addition, the information obtained through flat part-based propagation analysis can be used to add sensors within the flat parts to increase the probability of fault detection, thus increasing the robustness of the system under study.  },

            Constraint-based formalisms are a useful and common way to deal with temporal reasoning tasks. Assertions represent temporal constraints between temporal objects, time-points or intervals: Metric temporal constraints between time points permit us to express a minimum and maximum temporal distance between two time points and to define a valid temporal interval for each one. However, existing approaches have limited expressiveness for representing non-disjunctive qualitative constraints of point algebra and the empirical results do not seem very adequate for managing a great number of time points or when the time for management is limited.In this paper, an efficient and expressive time point and duration-based temporal representation model with metric constraints is presented. The main features of the model refer to the formal properties of the internal time model and the specific representation of temporal constraints, which integrates constraints on time-points and on durations and is more adequate for their computational management. Sound and complete management processes are specified on the basis of model properties. From this specification, two choices for management are proposed: (i) with neither propagation nor preprocessing techniques, complete management algorithms have an O(e*n) complexity, but a linear empirical cost is obtained; (ii) with complete propagation an O(n

  abstract={ Abstract  We deal with a challenging scheduling problem on parallel machines with sequence-dependent setup times and release dates from a real-world application of semiconductor work-shop production. There, jobs can only be processed by dedicated machines, thus few machines can determine the makespan almost regardless of how jobs are scheduled on the remaining ones. This causes problems when machines fail and jobs need to be rescheduled. Instead of optimising only the makespan, we put the individual machine spans in non-ascending order and lexicographically minimise the resulting tuples. This achieves that all machines complete as early as possible and increases the robustness of the schedule. We study the application of answer-set programming (ASP) to solve this problem. While ASP eases modelling, the combination of timing constraints and the considered objective function challenges current solving technology. The former issue is addressed by using an extension of ASP by difference logic. For the latter, we devise different algorithms that use multi-shot solving. To tackle industrial-sized instances, we study different approximations and heuristics. Our experimental results show that ASP is indeed a promising knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) paradigm for this problem and is competitive with state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers. },

  abstract={ Abstract  In proposing a machine learning approach for a flow shop scheduling problem with alternative resources, sequence-dependent setup times, and blocking, this paper seeks to generate a tree-based priority rule in terms of a well-performing decision tree (DT) for dispatching jobs. Furthermore, generating a generic DT and RF that yields competitive results for instance scenarios that structurally differ from the training instances was another goal of our research. The proposed DT relies on high quality solutions, obtained using a constraint programming (CP) formulation. Novel aspects include a unified representation of job sequencing and machine assignment decisions, as well as the generation of random forests (RF) to counteract overfitting behaviour. To show the performance of the proposed approaches, different instance scenarios for two objectives (makespan and total tardiness minimisation) were implemented, based on randomised problem data. The background of this approach is a real-world physical system of an industrial partner that represents a typical shop floor for many production processes, such as furniture and window construction. The results of a comparison of the DT and RF approach with two priority dispatching rules, the original CP solutions and tight lower bounds retrieved from a strengthened mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation show that the proposed machine learning approach performs well in most instance sets for the makespan objective and in all sets for the total tardiness objective.

  abstract={ The bus transit system is promising to enable electric and autonomous vehicles for massive urban mobility, which relies on high-level automation and efficient resource management. Besides the on-road automation, the in-depot automated scheduling for battery recharging has not been adequately studied yet. This paper presents an integrated in-depot routing and recharging scheduling (IDRRS) problem, which is modeled as a constraint programming (CP) problem with Boolean satisfiability conditions (SAT). The model is converted to a flexible job-shop problem (FJSP) and is feasible to be solved by a CP-SAT solver for the optimal solution or feasible solutions with acceptable performance. This paper also presents a case study in Shanghai and compares the results from the FJSP model and the first-come first-serve (FCFS) method. The result demonstrates the allocation of routes and chargers under multiple scenarios with different numbers of chargers. The results show that the FJSP model shortens the delay and increases the time conservation for future rounds of operation than FCFS, while FCFS presents the simplicity of programming and better computational efficiency. The multiple random input test suggests that the proposed approach can decide the minimum number of chargers for stochastic charging requests. The proposed method can conserve the investment by increasing the utilization of automated recharging devices, improving vehicles’ in-depot efficiency. },

  abstract={ In this paper, we propose a variable block insertion heuristic (VBIH) algorithm to solve the permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSP). The VBIH algorithm removes a block of jobs from the current solution. It applies an insertion local search to the partial solution. Then, it inserts the block into all possible positions in the partial solution sequentially. It chooses the best one amongst those solutions from block insertion moves. Finally, again an insertion local search is applied to the complete solution. If the new solution obtained is better than the current solution, it replaces the current solution with the new one. As long as it improves, it retains the same block size. Otherwise, the block size is incremented by one and a simulated annealing-based acceptance criterion is employed to accept the new solution in order to escape from local minima. This process is repeated until the block size reaches its maximum size. To verify the computational results, mixed integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) models are developed and solved using very recent small VRF benchmark suite. Optimal solutions are found for 108 out of 240 instances. Extensive computational results on the VRF large benchmark suite show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm. 236 out of 240 instances of large VRF benchmark suite are further improved for the first time in this paper. Ultimately, we run Taillard’s benchmark suite and compare the algorithms. In addition to the above, three instances of Taillard’s benchmark suite are also further improved for the first time in this paper since 1993. },

  abstract={ Summary  This paper describes a learning parallel constraint programming (CP) solver designed for solving CP problems with several instances on massively parallel computing platforms comprising multi‐core parallel machines or Many Integrated Cores. The CP solver proposed in this work is based on a  Portfolio  parallelization that employs a linear reward inaction learning algorithm in order to obtain the best possible performance for a large set of instances of the same problem. The linear reward inaction algorithm enables the prediction of the number of cores to be assigned to each search strategy based on previous experiments, reducing the computing time required to solve constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. The underlying principle of the  Portfolio  approach is to run  N  sequential search strategies using  N  computing cores ( N  To  N  Portfolio ) where each core uses its own strategy in order to perform a search that is different from strategies used by the other cores. The first strategy that finds a solution stops all other strategies. The problem with the  N  To  N  Portfolio  approach is that the number of search strategies is very small compared with the current number of computing cores used by the parallel machines. However, using an internal parallelization for each search strategy, it is possible to run  N  parallel search using  P  computing cores with  P  ≫  N  ( N  To  P  Portfolio ). This  N  To  P  Portfolio  performs suboptimally for solving different CP problems because many computing resources are wasted. To improve this  Portfolio  model, an adaptive  N  To  P  Portfolio  was proposed, which tries to privilege the strategy that is most likely to find a solution first in order to give it more computing cores than the other strategies. However, the main problem with the adaptive  Portfolio  is that it loses all the learned information at the end of each search; it is designed to solve just one CP problem. Furthermore, many computational resources are wasted by both  Portfolio  solvers, the non‐adaptive ( N  To  N  and  N  To  P ) and the adaptive  N  To  P  Portfolio , when employed in some industrial projects, such as the  PAJERO  project, which always solves different instances of the same CP problem. To minimize the amount of wasted resources and to learn the most efficient search strategies, we propose a new learning  Portfolio  solver that uses a learning algorithm that configures automatically number of cores to each search. The performance obtained using the different  Portfolio  solvers is compared and illustrated by solving CP problems using as example the Google OR‐Tools solver.

  abstract={ We test the relevance of a model-based approach for sizing and optimizing complex systems. Classically a model-based approach is characterized by a clear partition between the problem description and the solving process. In the case of a design problem, we show that the sizing task could be systematically characterized and therefore could lead to a declarative model combining both system description and design requirements. Once translated into a constraint satisfaction problem, the resulting model can be solved with interval constraint programming methods and algorithms. Our first contribution to this approach is to precisely characterize the sizing task in design. The resulting terminology enables us to easily and systematically express the problem as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) which combines in the same model the system description and the design requirements. We have tested the approach on the optimal sizing problem of a power transmission system. Previous authors have described this scalable case study. They provide a mathematical formulation of the problem and solve it with an evolutionary algorithm. Starting from their description, we apply our methodology to model the problem as a CSP and then solve it with interval constraint programming algorithms. Our solutions are more adequate both in computational time and in optimization results than those published in the literature on the same problem. Moreover the declarative nature of constraint programming makes modifications or extensions easier than with evolutionary programming. The explanation of these results is our second contribution to the approach. However some important modelling issues remain to address in order to capture more and more complex system specifications. Further research is presented at the end of this paper. },

  abstract={  Currently, distributed supply chain production planning (SCPP) is a practical problem affecting global supply chain production. Distributed SCPP is a complex constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) comprising a series of constraints intra- and inter-production members on orders, capacity, and materials. Previous studies have proposed various advanced planning and scheduling (APS) algorithms for companies to solve internal CSPs related to production planning. Distributed SCPP problems additionally require a coordination approach to resolve conflicts among the production plans of individual production members. Several distributed CSP (DCSP) algorithms have been proposed to guide the coordination for various DCSP conditions and objectives. Based on these techniques, we propose a coordination approach for achieving consistency among individual production plans to develop an integral supply chain production plan. First, we employed an APS system to resolve the internal production planning constraints and to develop a feasible production plan for each production member. Next, we developed a hybrid DCSP coordination algorithm based on agent-ordering asynchronous weak-commitment search (AWS) algorithm and asynchronous incremental relaxation (IR) algorithm concepts to facilitate production planning coordination and resolve constraint conflicts among individual production plans. Finally, a thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) supply chain was used to illustrate and verify the proposed coordination approach.  },

                A method is developed to solve the problem of open-pit mine production scheduling, which is based on Constraint Programming and is used in working out an optimal plan of mining operations, taking into account heterogeneous economical, technological and some others requirements imposed by the customer. An original model is proposed to represent the problem considered as a constraint satisfaction problem. As the customer may verify the requirements, the domain model should enable addition of the new constraints and/or eliminate the existing ones. With the domain model being developed, the method proposed makes it possible to reach accurate solutions at the expense of highly effective reduction algorithms for each type of constraints and at the expense of specialized heuristics for non-perspective alternatives reduction in a search tree. The approach proposed enables addition of different constraints, even those for which it is difficult to find an analytical expression. },

  abstract={  Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful paradigm for various types of hard combinatorial problems. Constraint propagation techniques, such as arc consistency (AC), are used within solvers to prune inconsistent values from the domains of the variables and narrow down the search space. Local consistencies stronger than AC have the potential to prune the search space even more, but they are not widely used because they incur a high run time penalty in cases where they are unsuccessful. All constraint propagation techniques are sequential by nature, and thus they cannot be scaled up to modern multicore machines. For this reason, research on parallelizing constraint propagation is very limited. Contributing towards this direction, we exploit the parallelization possibilities of modern CPUs in tandem with strong local propagation methods in a novel way. Instead of trying to parallelize constraint propagation algorithms, we propose two search algorithms that apply different propagation methods in parallel. Both algorithms consist of a master search process, which is a typical CP solver, and a number of slave processes, with each one implementing a strong propagation method. The first algorithm runs the different propagators synchronously at each node of the search tree explored in the master process, while the second one can run them asynchronously at different nodes of the search tree. Preliminary experimental results on well-established benchmarks display the promise of our research by illustrating that our algorithms have execution times equal to those of serial solvers, in the worst case, while being faster in most cases.  },

Therefore, optimal scheduling of design change propagations is required to reduce the total process time. This article presents an integrated approach for scheduling design changes in the complex product development process by combining simulation of change propagations with optimization algorithms. The process model is built using “And/or” graphs, which can take the logic relationships among design tasks into the process model. Genetic algorithm is applied to the change process model to find the optimal propagation likelihood for each optional propagation path in order to obtain the shortest process run time. The approach is incorporated into the process-oriented computer-aided product design system, and two design changes occurring in the motorcycle engine design process, namely an initiated and an emergent design changes, are used to test the approach. The initiated design change case shows the integrated approach can find the optimal solution more efficiently than the Monte Carlo simulation method, while the emergent change case demonstrates the approach can timely find the optimal solution to the change especially when designers are pressed for delivery of their achievements.  },

The substitution of traditional trucks in the last-mile distribution by a UAV fleet can contribute to urban sustainability by reducing air pollution and increasing urban freight efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach to the joint proactive and reactive planning of deliveries by a UAV fleet. We develop a receding horizon-based approach to reactive, online planning for the UAV fleet’s mission. We considered the delivery of goods to spatially dispersed customers over an assumed time horizon. Forecasted weather changes affect the energy consumption of UAVs and limit their range. Therefore, consideration should be given to plans for follow-up tasks, previously unmet needs, and predictions of disturbances over a moving time horizon. We propose a set of reaction rules that can be encountered during delivery in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment. We implement a constraint programming paradigm, which is well suited to cope with the nonlinearity of the system’s characteristics. The proposed approach to online reactive UAV routing is evaluated in several instances. The computational experiments have shown that the developed model is capable of providing feasible plans for a UAV fleet’s mission that are robust to changes in weather and customer’s orders. },

We assumed that the scheduling activity would take place within two dual spaces: the constraints space (CS) and the objects space (OS). Constraints are defined in the strictest sense as relations between variables that cannot be represented in the solution (timetable), whereas objects are constraint satisfactions that can be thus represented. The study shows that experts were more likely than novices to use external representations as activity support. They satisfied many constraints with partially defined objects. On the contrary, novices devoted a long time to managing constraints in their heads before defining only fully specified objects (concrete objects). The objects space could be a suitable activity support for experts. Novices, on the other hand, could benefit from support in managing constraints and translating constraints into objects. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. },

On the one hand, the used constraint formalism allows the integration of very fine-grained optimization tasks by fuzzy constraints, which a roster may partially satisfy and partially violate. On the other hand, the described system uses an any-time algorithm to search good rosters. A meta-problem is generated from the constraint representation of the problem to identify reasons for constraint violations in order to improve the search for improvement steps.  },

  abstract={ Abstract  Facing economic pressure and case-based compensation systems, hospitals strive for effectively planning patient hospitalization and making efficient use of their resources. To support this endeavor, this paper proposes a flexible hierarchical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based approach for the day-level scheduling of clinical pathways (CP). CP form sequences of ward stays and treatments to be performed during a patient’s hospitalization under consideration of all relevant resources such as beds, operating rooms and clinical staff. Since in most hospitals CP-related information needed for planning is not readily available, we propose a data-driven approach in which the structure of the CP to be scheduled including all CP-related constraints is automatically extracted from standardized hospital billing data available in every German hospital. The approach uses a flexible multi-criteria objective function considering several patient- and hospital-related aspects which makes our approach applicable in various scenarios. Furthermore, in contrast to other approaches, it considers several practically relevant aspects ensuring the implementability of the scheduling results such as multiple ward stays per hospitalization and gender-separated room assignments. Regarding the treatment resources such as operation rooms and clinical staff, it considers the eligibility of resources for treatments based on information such as special equipment or qualification and represents complex resources individually to avoid disaggregation problems. To allow solving the resulting complex and large-scale scheduling problem for realistically dimensioned problem instances, we propose a hierarchical two-stage MILP approach involving carefully designed anticipation components in the first-stage model. We evaluate our approach in a case study with real-world data from a German university hospital showing that our approach is able to solve instances with a planning horizon of 1 month exhibiting 1088 treatments and 302 ward stays of 286 patients. In addition to comparing our approach to a monolithic MILP approach, we provide a detailed discussion of the scheduling results for two practically motivated scenarios. },

An analytical model is used to consider refreshing the competences of the team’s multi-skilled members and shaping the structure of staff’s competences to maximize their mutual substitutability in processes typical for a multi-item lot-size production. Its impact on maintaining the skill level of employees is important in cases of an unplanned event, e.g., caused by employee absenteeism and/or a change in the priorities of orders carried out, disrupting the task of software companies. The developed model implemented in the constraint programming environment enables the formulation of decision-making versions of both the problem of analysis (seeking an answer to the question to discover whether there is a solution that meets the given expectations) and synthesis (seeking an answer to the question, assuming there is a solution that meets the given expectations). The potential of the proposed reference model-based approach is illustrated with examples. },

Designers have to put an appropriate procedure in place to handle these changes in order to realize successful product development in a timely and cost-effective manner. When many change propagation paths are present, selection of the best change evolution paths and distribution of change results to downstream tasks become critical to the progress management of the project. In this paper, based on the available change propagation simulation algorithm, a global sensitivity analysis method known as elementary effects (EE) is employed to rank the importance of each potential propagation path with those involved design dependencies in the process. Further, an EE-based heuristic design dependency encoding method is applied to the genetic algorithm which is then adopted to schedule the change updating process. Finally, the optimal results obtained by the complete search and the heuristic dependency encoding methods are compared to illustrate the improvements and effectiveness of the latter method.  },

The emulator network comprises one or more multiport radio frequency hubs, with variable attenuation on each port, in order to emulate the radio path loss between any two radios. The problem in this emulation approach is the determination of the appropriate port attenuation to match the multi-dimensional link losses (signal attenuations) and signal-to-interference ratios between multiple radios of a practical network. This has been structured as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) for both single-hub and multiple-hub emulation. We describe an algorithm based on Freuder’s solution synthesis to find the solution to the CSP. For emulation with multiple hubs, a clustering algorithm is described to assign radios to different hubs. Experimental results are also presented to validate the accuracy of emulation.  },

Mathematically, resource allocation is an optimization problem, where the limitations are fully known, the optimization criteria are clearly and precisely defined and all this takes place in predictable conditions. The development of fully automated systems for solving allocation problems is often rejected by end users. The reason may be limitations that are often difficult to fully register, decision criteria are difficult to determine, and users are not experts in using complex mathematical concepts such as large matrices of mathematical programming or weighting factors of multicriteria optimization. },

  abstract={ Abstract  Researchers in answer set programming and constraint programming have spent significant efforts in the development of hybrid languages and solving algorithms combining the strengths of these traditionally separate fields. These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set programming. Constraint answer set programming languages and systems proved to be successful at providing declarative, yet efficient solutions to problems involving hybrid reasoning tasks. One of the main contributions of this paper is the first comprehensive account of the constraint answer set language and solver  ezcsp , a mainstream representative of this research area that has been used in various successful applications. We also develop an extension of the transition systems proposed by Nieuwenhuis  et al.  in 2006 to capture Boolean satisfiability solvers. We use this extension to describe the  ezcsp  algorithm and prove formal claims about it. The design and algorithmic details behind  ezcsp  clearly demonstrate that the development of the hybrid systems of this kind is challenging. Many questions arise when one faces various design choices in an attempt to maximize system's benefits. One of the key decisions that a developer of a hybrid solver makes is settling on a particular integration schema within its implementation. Thus, another important contribution of this paper is a thorough case study based on  ezcsp , focused on the various integration schemas that it provides. },

  abstract={ An increasing number of distributed data-driven applications are moving into shared public clouds. By sharing resources and operating at scale, public clouds promise higher utilization and lower costs than private clusters. To achieve high utilization, however, cloud providers inevitably allocate virtual machine instances noncontiguously, i.e., instances of a given application may end up in physically distant machines in the cloud. This allocation strategy can lead to large differences in average latency between instances. For a large class of applications, this difference can result in significant performance degradation, unless care is taken in how application components are mapped to instances. 
           In this paper, we propose ClouDiA, a general deployment advisor that selects application node deployments minimizing either (i) the largest latency between application nodes, or (ii) the longest critical path among all application nodes. ClouDiA employs mixed-integer programming and constraint programming techniques to efficiently search the space of possible mappings of application nodes to instances. Through experiments with synthetic and real applications in Amazon EC2, we show that our techniques yield a 15% to 55% reduction in time-to-solution or service response time, without any need for modifying application code. },

  abstract={ We deal with a challenging scheduling problem on parallel-machines with sequence-dependent setup times and release dates from a real-world application of semiconductor work-shop production. There, jobs can only be processed by dedicated machines, thus few machines can determine the makespan almost regardless of how jobs are scheduled on the remaining ones. This causes problems when machines fail and jobs need to be rescheduled. Instead of optimising only the makespan, we put the individual machine spans in non-ascending order and lexicographically minimise the resulting tuples. This achieves  that all machines complete as early as possible and increases the robustness of the schedule. We study the application of Answer-Set Programming (ASP) to solve this problem. While ASP eases modelling, the combination of timing constraints and the considered objective function challenges current solving technology. The former issue is addressed by using an extension of ASP by difference logic. For the latter, we devise different algorithms that use multi-shot solving. To tackle industrial-sized instances, we study different approximations and heuristics. Our experimental results show that ASP is indeed a promising KRR paradigm for this problem and is competitive with state-of-the-art CP and MIP solvers. },

                A declarative framework enabling to determine conditions as well as to develop decision-making software supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises aimed at unique, multi-project-like and mass customized oriented production is discussed. A set of unique production orders grouped into portfolio orders is considered. Operations executed along different production orders share available resources following a mutual exclusion protocol. A unique product or production batch is completed while following a given activity’s network order. The problem concerns scheduling a newly inserted project portfolio subject to constraints imposed by a multi-project environment The answers sought are: Can a given project portfolio specified by its cost and completion time be completed within the assumed time period in a manufacturing system in hand? Which manufacturing system capability guarantees the completion of a given project portfolio ordered under assumed cost and time constraints? The considered problems regard finding a computationally effective approach aimed at simultaneous routing and allocation as well as batching and scheduling of a newly ordered project portfolio subject to constraints imposed by a multi-project environment. The main objective is to provide a declarative model enabling to state a constraint satisfaction problem aimed at multi-project-like and mass customized oriented production scheduling. Multiple illustrative examples are discussed. },

  abstract={  Backtracking search is often the method of choice for solving constraint satisfaction and propositional satisfiability problems. Previous studies have shown that portfolios of backtracking algorithms — a selection of one or more algorithms plus a schedule for executing the algorithms — can dramatically improve performance on some instances. In this paper, we consider a setting that often arises in practice where the instances to be solved arise over time, the instances all belong to some class of problem instances, and a limit or deadline is placed on the computational resources that can be consumed in solving any instance. For such a scenario, we present a simple scheme for learning a good portfolio of backtracking algorithms from a small sample of instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation using two testbeds: real-world instruction scheduling problems and the widely used quasigroup completion problems.  },

  abstract={ The presented problem concerns the route planning of a UAV fleet carrying out deliveries to spatially dispersed customers in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment within a specified timeframe. The developed model allows for predictive (i.e., taking into account forecasted changing weather conditions) and reactive (i.e., enabling contingency UAVs rerouting) delivery mission planning (i.e., NP-hard problem) in terms of the constraint satisfaction problem. Due to the need to implement an emergency return of the UAV to the base or handling ad hoc ordered deliveries, sufficient conditions have been developed. Checking that these conditions are met allows cases to be eliminated if they do not guarantee acceptable solutions, thereby allowing the calculations to be sped up. The experiments carried out showed the usefulness of the proposed approach in DSS-based contingency planning of the UAVs’ mission performed in a dynamic environment. },

  abstract={  During the past decade, inland vessels have gained importance in container transport because of their reliability, low environmental impact, and major capacity for increased exploitation. Although inland vessels are crucial in container transport between terminals in the port and the hinterland, in a large seaport like the one in Rotterdam, Netherlands, only 62% of the inland vessels leave the port on time. The other vessels have to stay in the port area for a longer time than planned. This situation leads to uncertainty in waiting times of vessels at terminals and low utilization of terminal quay resources. A two-phase approach is proposed that integrates mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) to solve the problem by generating optimal rotation plans for inland vessels. In the first phase, the single-vessel optimization problem is formulated on the basis of MIP and solved with state-of-the-art MIP solvers. In the second phase, the multiple-vessel coordination problem is formulated on the basis of CP, and a large neighborhood search–based heuristic is proposed to solve the problem. Commercial CP solvers are also used for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed large neighborhood search–based heuristic outperforms the commercial CP solver with regard to both the solution quality and the computation time. Moreover, simulation results with respect to departure time of the last vessel, total sojourn time, and waiting time show significant improvement with earlier departure times and shorter sojourn times and waiting times.  },
