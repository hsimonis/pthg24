\section{Introduction}

This document shows the result of a survey on "Constraint Programming and Scheduling", which tries to find and classify all publications on the combination of these two concepts. It is based on a manually collected bibfile containing reference to relevant papers and articles, and on an automatic and manual analysis of local copies of the cited papers. For copyright reasons, we are obviously not able to distribute the collected copies, but we provide links to the original sources of the files. 

We identify the papers by a key which is the last name of the first author, the first character of the last names of all other authors, and a two digit year code for the date of publication. If multiple works would define the same key, we differentiate by adding a suffix "a", "b", etc, to the second and subsequent works found.

Most of the content of this document is generated by a Java program that parses the bib files, adds any manually extracted information, and which then extracts concept occurrences from the local copies of the works. It then produces tables and other LaTeX  artifacts that are included in a manually defined top-level document.

To add new works, first add bibtex entries for each work in the main \texttt{overview/bib.bib} file, then add local copies of the pdf of the work to the \texttt{overview/works/} directory, using the key of the bibtex entry as the file name (plus extension .pdf), and then run the main Java program \texttt{org.insightcentre.pthg24.JfxApp} to consolidate the information and extract the relevant concepts. Finally, run \texttt{pdflatex} on the \texttt{overview/scheduling.tex} file to produce this pdf document. Manually extracted information for the files can be added in the \texttt{imports/manual.csv} file. New concepts can be added in the file \texttt{imports/concepts.json}, new concept types need to be directly defined in the Java code.

We start the document by providing a table of all defined keys in the bib file in alphabetical order. This table can be helpful to see if a candidate paper is already in the survey, it suffices to see if the key is already present, and matches the authors, title and origin of the candidate paper. In the table link given by the key points to the local copy of the file, while the citation number links to the bibliography entry. That entry typically also contains a link to the original source of the paper.

This document heavily depends on the use of hyper links in the document, it has been tested with Acrobat Reader, other pdf reader may not use links in the same way.

\section{Conference Paper List}

This section presents the information for all conference papers included in the survey. For space reasons, not all information about the papers can be presented in a single table, we therefore split the data into three parts. The first part contains the main bibliographical information for the paper. The paper are sorted by year of publication (newest first), and then alphabetically by key. 

The key contains a hyperlink to the original source URL of the paper. You may have to navigate manually to download the actual paper content, and you may be unable to access the paper completely if it is behind a paywall for which you (or your organization) do not have access.

We then list the authors of the paper, in the other given in the bibtex file, abbreviating first names for space where we can identify them. Note that names with non-latin characters are not handled by latex. We use the form that is given in the bibtex file, but have excluded entries that cause latex to fail.  

We then give the title of the publication, using the original capitalization of the title entry in the bibtex entry, which may differ from the format shown in the bibliography. We then (column LC) provide a link to a local copy, if it is present, and a link to the bibliography entry of the paper.  We also show the year of publication, and the conference where the paper was published, using a short form abbreviation of the conference. This relies on a matching routine in the Java code to find the short title, new conference series may require an additional entry in \texttt{ImportBibtex.java} to work properly. Finally we list the number of pages of the paper, this information is using the bibtex entry where possible, otherwise uses \texttt{pdfinfo} to extract the actual number of pages from the local copy. The final columns b and c provide links to the corresponding tables of extracted concepts and manual information. Note that the links to typically show the correct page, not do not necessarily scroll to the correct line in the table.

\section{Concept Matching}

In order to automatically find out properties of the articles, we try to find certain concepts in the pdf versions of the articles. We manually defined an ontology of important concepts to look for, and defined regular expressions that would recognize these concepts in the text. We use the \emph{pdfgrep} command to search for the number of occurrences of certain regular expressions in the files. This often clearly identifies the constraints used in the model. We group the results by number of occurrences of the concept in the text of the work. Note that this is only approximate, as we do include the full pdf file in the search. A concept might only be mentioned in some of the title of citations used in the paper, we do count them in our results, as we were not able to remove the bibliography from the main body of the work.

Overall, if a work is not mentioned as using the concept, the the text does not contain a match to the corresponding regular expression. A fundamental limitation of this approach is that it only really works for text written in the language the regular expressions are designed for (in our case English), and not those written in another language. We could overcome this limitation by defining all concepts in other languages as well, and then using a language flag to identify the language the text is written in. 

Note that we only show the first 30 matching entries in each concept category, and list the total number of matches if there are more than 30 matches.

\section{Papers and Articles Missing a Local Copy}

This section lists all papers and articles for which we were not able to locate an electronic copy that we could download to our system. This might be because the work is behind a paywall for which we do not have access, or since the paper only exists in hardcopy, for works from the start of the period covered. As in either case we are not able to extract useful information from the work, either automatically, or manually, without the actual text itself, these gaps should be closed where possible.

\section{Papers and Articles Without Recognized Concepts}

This section lists papers and articles for which we have a pdf local copy, but where we were not able to extract any of the defined concepts. This can basically have two reasons. We either have included a paper which is not at all related to scheduling, so that none of the defined concepts occur in the paper. A  more likely cause is that the pdf file is a scanned document for which optical character recognition was not run or not successful, so that the pdf consists of a series of bitmap images. In that case, pdfgrep is unable to find any text in the document, and no matches for concepts are found. It may be useful to check the pdf files to see if that is the case.

\clearpage
\section{Unmatched Concepts}

This section lists those concepts for which no matches were found. The most likely cause is a mistake in the regular expression used to find the concept, but it is also possible that some concept simply is not mentioned in any of the documents.
