\chapter{Introduction}
This document serves as the reference manual for the pthg24 application.

It describes the different features of the system, and lists the possible user interaction with the application. 

This document is automatically generated from the model of the application. Changes to the format should be relatively easy to implement by updating \textbf{manual.ecl} in the \textbf{prolog} directory.

Whenever the model is modified, an updated version of this document will be generated by the Makefile in the Prolog directory. This ensures correspondence of features described in the document with the implemented system.

The system currently requires manual creation of the screendumps used in the manual. After a major change in the application, it is a good idea to clean out all images in the images directory and to re-create them all by running the application through all windows and operations.
